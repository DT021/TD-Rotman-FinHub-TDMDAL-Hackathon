Welcome to the AbbVie Third 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. (Operator Instructions). This call is being recorded by AbbVie.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Larry Peepo, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Larry Peepo","Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Joining us for the question-and-answer portion of the call are Laura Schumacher, Executive Vice President Business Development, External Affairs and General Counsel, and Mike Severino, Executive Vice President of R&D and Chief Scientific Officer.","Before we get started, I\u2019ll remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.","Additional information about the factors that may affect AbbVie\u2019s operations is included in our 2013 Annual other SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law.","On today\u2019s conference call as in the past non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie\u2019s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website.","Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll take your questions.","So, And with that I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Gonzalez","Thank you, Larry. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. During today\u2019s call, I\u2019ll spend a few minutes on our strong results in the quarter as well as our performance since we launched as an independent company. I\u2019ll also discuss our pipeline advancement including forthcoming data and other milestones.","I\u2019ll then turn the call over to Bill who will provide additional color regarding the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year. We\u2019ll also make sure we leave enough time for your questions.","Since launching AbbVie 22 months ago, we are focused on driving strong performance, creating shareholder value and building a robust pipeline to derive future growth. To that end, we have delivered a total shareholder return of more than 90%, representing $40 billion of shareholder value creation.","Today, we reported robust third quarter results with adjusted earnings per share of $0.89, significantly exceeding our guidance range for the quarter. This included operational sales growth of more than 8%, also ahead of our outlook for the quarter. We drove this performance with double-digit growth across a number of products including, HUMIRA, Synagis, Synthroid, Duodopa and Creon.","In the quarter, we also delivered improvements in gross margin and continued to invest in the business for future growth. And for the second time this year, we significantly raised our full-year EPS guidance range for 2014, reflecting the robust performance of our underlying business and positive trends we expect through the remainder of the year.","This guidance reflects EPS growth for 2014 despite the headwinds created by the loss of exclusivity in our lipids franchise. Our results demonstrate the strength and sustainability of our portfolio and they underscore our continued focus and execution.","Our third quarter results were led by HUMIRA, which delivered, nearly 18% global operational growth. HUMIRA\u2019s performance was driven by several factors including continued market growth resulting from increasing penetration across therapeutic categories and geographies.","As we\u2019ve indicated in the past, HUMIRA\u2019s broad label and new indications are a competitive advantage. We recently reported positive results from our Phase 3 studies of HUMIRA in HS, a chronic inflammatory skin disease that currently has no approved treatment options. We\u2019re on track to submit our U.S. and European regulatory applications for HS this year.","We\u2019ve also spent the last several years, developing and implementing a strategy that we believe will protect and grow our leadership position in immunology including product enhancements and intellectual property. And behind HUMIRA we have a number of promising immunology assets and development.","As a result, we are confident in our strategies to defend our position across our immunology categories.","Our interferon-free HCV therapy represents another exciting vehicle for strong growth. We\u2019re on the cusp of approval with the regulatory reviews progressing very well. We\u2019re actively engaged with regulators on various fronts and have completed our pre-approval manufacturing and clinical inspections.","As we said at a healthcare conference last month, we do not expect that an advisory committee meeting will be required prior to U.S. approval. In anticipation of U.S. commercialization by year-end and European approval in early 2015, we\u2019ve built the appropriate infrastructure and are fully prepared for our launch.","Our next generation HCV program also continues to progress well. We\u2019re currently conducting Phase 2b studies and expect to transition the Phase 3 development in 2015.","Beyond HCV, we have a robust pipeline of promising development programs. These programs stand especially therapeutic areas and include both biologics and small molecules. All told, we have more than 40 active clinical development programs underway, this includes 12 products in Phase 3 development or currently under regulatory review.","We have a high level of enthusiasm in our oncology pipeline, which includes 10 new molecular entities being studied in more than 55 clinical trials. In collaboration with Roche, we will present additional data on ABT-199 at an upcoming medical meeting, including Phase 1 data on AML and early data from a trial combining ABT-199 with Gazyva.","We\u2019ll also see data from a large single-agent study in relapsed refractory CLL patients with 17-p dilution in early 2015.","As a reminder, if the data warn and regulatory authorities agree to ABT-199, addresses an unmet medical need in this patient population. These data have the potential to support an early pathway to registration.","Veliparib is our PARP inhibitor in development for a wide range of solid tumors. Over the past year, we have initiated four pivotal studies. This includes Phase 3 trials in neoadjuvant breast cancer BRCA breast cancer and most recently two studies in non-small cell lung cancer than include patients with squamous and non-squamous cancers.","We\u2019re also excited about ABT-414, our anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody drug conjugate being evaluated in combination with Chemotherapy for glioblastoma multiforme, the most common and most aggressive type of malignant primary brain tumor.","We were recently granted orphaned drug designation for ABT-414 by the EMA and FDA. And we are moving aggressively to start a Phase 2 study in patients with GBM by early next year.","Also on our late stage development on Oncology pipeline is elotuzumab in partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb for multiple myeloma. Results from the pivotal trial in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma patients are expected in early 2015.","Our late stage neuroscience pipeline includes daclizumab and Duopa. Daclizumab is in development for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Despite advances in the MS category, there continues to be a significant need for novel, high-efficacy agents with favorable benefit risk profiles. And we believe Daclizumab has the potential to be an important therapy in this large and growing market.","We presented promising pivotal trial data earlier this year, which demonstrated patients treated with daclizumab had a statistically significant 45% reduction in annualized relapse rates versus Avonex. We have begun to engage with global regulatory authorities and are working with our partner to complete our regulatory applications in the first half of 2015.","Duopa, is AbbVie\u2019s novel therapy for advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease. It is currently under regulatory review in the U.S. with an FDA action expected in early 2015.","Elagolix is our compound in Phase 3 development for endometriosis and Phase 2b for uterine fibroids. We continue to expect to see initial data from the first of two pivotal studies in endometriosis later this year and plan to report top line data shortly thereafter. We also see data from the mid-stage program in uterine fibroids next year as well.","As I mentioned, we have a number of promising immunology assets in development, including oral selective JAK1 inhibitors, several biologics and two by specific biologics currently in mid-stage trials.","We expect to see data from the selective JAK1 inhibitors next year, allowing us to make a decision regarding Phase 3 development.","In summary, we delivered excellent performance in the quarter and our pipeline continues to evolve. We\u2019re on the verge of a number of important milestones including the commercialization of our interferon-free HCV combination and we\u2019re prepared for a successful launch.","AbbVie is poised to deliver top-tier performance including strong sales and earnings growth beginning in 2015. We have a high degree of confidence in our strategy and our performance.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill for a more detailed view of our results. Bill?","Bill Chase","Thank you, Rick. This morning I\u2019ll review our third quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for the remainder of 2014. This was another very strong quarter for AbbVie as we exceeded our guidance on both the top and bottom line.","Total sales increased 8.3% on an operational basis, excluding 0.5% on favorable impact from foreign exchange. HUMIRA delivered global sales of more than $3.2 billion up 17.8% operationally and up 17.5% on a reported basis.","In the United States, HUMIRA sales increased 25.3% driven by continued market expansion, strong prescription trends and share gains partially offset by a reduction in retail buying patterns.","Internally, HUMIRA sales grew 10.3% on an operational basis excluding a 0.6% unfavorable impact from exchange. International growth was driven by strong underlying trends including the uptake of new indications and share gains but was partially offset by the timing of shipments in international markets. We continue to see double-digit market growth for HUMIRA in most international markets.","Certainly we are well on track to significantly exceed our original full-year guidance for HUMIRA.","AndroGel sales were $232 million, down 6.7% from the prior year quarter. We continue to see a notable slowdown in the market with overall prescriptions down significantly. However, we did gain share from competitors during the quarter and benefited somewhat from favorable pricing trends.","U.S. sales of Synthroid were $200 million, up 24.3% year-over-year. Synthroid maintained strong brand loyalty and market leadership despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago. The overall market has experienced low-single digit growth with Synthroid growth outpacing the market including product pricing trends.","Global Lupron sales were $196 million in the quarter, up 0.4% on an operational basis. Lupron continues to hold a leadership position and maintain significant share of the market.","U.S. CREON sales were $148 million in the quarter, up 47.6%. CREON maintains its leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market where the product continues to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts. Growth in the quarter benefited from a favorable comparison to the prior year quarter.","Sales of Synagis were $109 million in the third quarter up 18.3% on an operational basis. Synagis which protects at risk infants from severe respiratory disease is a seasonal product with the majority of sales in the first and fourth quarters of the year. Growth in the quarter was driven by continued product uptake and strong commercial execution.","Sales of Duodopa on our therapy for advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease approved in Europe and other international markets were $56 million, up 20.8% on an operational basis this quarter. Performance is in line with recent trends as well as our full year outlook for the product.","And sales in our lipid franchise were down significantly due to generic competition. We expect these trends to continue for the remainder of 2014.","I\u2019ll now turn to the P&L profile for the third quarter. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 81.1% somewhat above our expectations and up 140 basis points year-over-year. This reflects the loss of exclusivity in our lipid franchise offset by favorable mix impacts across the portfolio as well as and margin enhancing initiatives we\u2019ve implemented.","Adjusted SG&A was 26.4% of sales in the third quarter, up more than 9% year-over-year reflecting continued investment in our growth brands and preparations for our upcoming HCV launch.","Adjusted R&D was 16.2% of sales in the third quarter up more than 14% versus the prior year quarter. As expected our absolute R&D investment was up sequentially over the second quarter as we increased funding of our mid and late stage pipeline assets and additional HUMIRA indications.","Adjusted net interest expense was $53 million and the adjusted tax rate was 22.4% in the quarter. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding non-cash intangible amortization expense and specified items were $0.89 well above our previous guidance range of $0.77 to $0.79. On a GAAP basis earnings per share were $0.31.","You will recall that in early September we updated our third quarter and full year GAAP EPS guidance to reflect upfront payments related to the infinity and calico agreements which were treated as specified items.","Also in accordance with the final regulations issued to the pharmaceutical industry in the third quarter by the IRS, AbbVie has booked an additional year of its branded prescription drug fee which we have treated as a specified item.","By way of background, starting in 2011, the pharma industry was acquired under the affordable care act to begin paying a fee based on branded prescription drugs sold to the U.S. government.","During the third quarter of this year, the IRS issued final regulations which changed the recognition of the fee from the period in which the fee was paid to the period for which the fee is owed.","As a result, the industry is now required from an accounting perspective to recognize in 2014 one additional year of the fee. There is no cash flow impact of this one-time adjustment.","Due to the timing of the termination of the Shire transaction, the majority of one-time costs related to that event were reflected in our fourth quarter results.","Moving on to our outlook for the remainder of the year, this morning we significantly raised our adjusted EPS guidance for 2014. We now expect adjusted earnings per share guidance of $3.25 to $3.27. As a reminder, our 2014 outlook continues to exclude any potential revenue from the expected 2014 U.S. launch of our HCV therapy.","Our revised GAAP guidance for the year includes the full impact of the Shire transaction costs. Given our strong product performance, we now expect sales to exceed $19.5 billion in 2014. We\u2019re forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 79% for the year reflecting product mix and actions we\u2019ve taken to further improve our margin profile.","We expect full year R&D expense to be somewhat above 16% of sales as we continue to advance our late stage pipeline. And we expect SG&A expense of around 27% of sales in 2014. We are forecasting net interest expense of about $250 million for the full year, and we continue to expect an adjusted tax rate just above 22%.","As you know, our business generates significant cash flow and we expect this to grow in 2015 and beyond with new product introductions. As a result, we announced last week that AbbVie\u2019s quarterly dividend will be increased by more than 16% to $0.49 beginning with the dividend payable in February 2015.","We intend to maintain our strong commitment to a growing dividend going forward. And we disclosed a new $5 billion share buyback program to be executed over the next several years, further reflecting our commitment to return cash to shareholders.","So, overall, we\u2019re very pleased with our strong third quarter performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of 2014.","And with that I\u2019ll turn it back over to Larry.","Larry Peepo","Thanks Bill. We\u2019ll now open the call for questions. Elon, we\u2019ll take our first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question is from Chris Schott from JMPC.","Chris Schott \u2013 JPMC","Great. Thanks very much for the questions. First one for Rick, operationally AbbVie seems to be obviously firing on all cylinders here. But with the Shire deal you highlighted the potential for greater access to your cash flow as well as the diversification that deal would bring.","So on those two topics, first can you talk about your access to cash flow and your ability to deploy capital on an ongoing basis with your current tax structure and the recent dividend increase?","And then second on the business development side, what is the sense of urgency at this point to further diversify AbbVie? And can you give us any color on the range of M&A options you are considering. I guess specifically should we think of Shire as a one-off or would the company still consider pursuing large-cap acquisitions? Thanks very much.","Rick Gonzalez","Okay. Hi Chris, it\u2019s Rick. I think this question has come up a couple of times now since the termination of the Shire agreement and in the backdrop of the Shire agreement.","And so, I think it\u2019s important to put it in perspective and important to acknowledge that at the outset, there are certain attributes of the Shire transaction that made it unique and out of the normal course of our M&A strategy. I\u2019d say specifically the potential for inversion is only offered with target selections of very significant size and the benefit of inversion allowed for an acquisition price that was obviously higher.","So, I think one of the things that you must remember as we approach the opportunity with Shire was against the backdrop of where was AbbVie overall, because I think that\u2019s an important perspective to keep in mind.","And if you think about the prospects of our business, they were never brighter than it were when we approached the Shire transaction.","We\u2019ve cleared most of our significant LOE events, our growth brands are exhibiting extremely strong growth, particularly HUMIRA, we build a deep, mid and late stage pipeline with several potential blockbusters which we believe will allow us to drive top-tier EPS growth starting in \u201815 and beyond, HCV is a good example of that, 199 is a good example of that, Daclizumab is a good example of that and there were many more.","And while I think it\u2019s fair to ask a question as our strategy, our M&A strategy changed following the Shire affair, I think it\u2019s also important to acknowledge that we\u2019re a company that\u2019s in even stronger position today than we were before we announced this deal.","Today\u2019s earnings show that very clearly, the base business is running stronger than our guidance at the beginning of the year suggested to us. We have a much better idea of the size of the HCV market and our potential to stake out a significant position in that market. We\u2019ve had positive data readouts on DAC 888, 199 continues to perform well. And we\u2019ve continued to be active in the L&A front.","So, there are no development really that have happened to our business, in fact any development that\u2019s happened has actually been a positive development. They don\u2019t leave us with a tremendous amount of confidence that we can drive the level of performance that we have projected and the level of performance that we need going forward from 2015 with our base strategy.","Which brings me to M&A. If you look at our cash flow and our ability to access that cash flow, we clearly have the where with all to be active in the M&A front. What\u2019s more is we have a track record in our ability and our willingness to pursue and acquire attractive assets, assuming two things, it makes strategic sense and they have a good financial return. That\u2019s essentially the criteria that we use.","We\u2019ve always said that our highest priority for our cash is to deploy it to further grow the business and make the business more and more healthy going forward. And I think you\u2019re going to expect us to continue to do exactly that, deploying cash to acquire attractive on-market and pipeline assets to further enhance our growth.","But what I don\u2019t think is that we absolutely have an imperative to one out and do another $50 billion deal, in fact I would tell you, we don\u2019t have that imperative. And it\u2019s unlikely that we would do another $50 billion deal.","As I said before, Shire is a unique opportunity based on a number of different factors, some of which don\u2019t exist in the same way as they did before. So, the underlying growth prospects for AbbVie don\u2019t require us to do a transaction that size.","I\u2019d also say we\u2019re not going to limit ourselves to what we do. We look at individual products, we look at mid-size companies and we look at larger companies. And we\u2019re going to continue to do that and continue to look for those opportunities that strategically fit and give us a strong financial return. And we\u2019ll deploy our capital accordingly.","The other thing I\u2019d say is, we have always committed that we\u2019ll return cash to shareholders and that\u2019s a commitment that we\u2019ve made as part of our cash, which I used to do that here recently with the dividend increase and the buyback program. Those are the two priorities for the cash.","The cash isn\u2019t trapped, obviously we have access to the cash for offshore acquisitions, we have access to the cash if we choose to repatriate it. Obviously, we have an incentive to look outside the U.S. first if we choose to, but we have total flexibility as it relates to our cash.","Larry Peepo","Thanks Chris. Elon, we\u2019ll take our next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Can you all hear me all right?","Bill Chase","We sure can.","Rick Gonzalez","Yes.","Jami Rubin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Congratulations on a terrific quarter.","Bill Chase","Thanks.","Jami Rubin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","This is either for Rick or Bill. Clearly 2015 is shaping up to be a huge year. I think 2014 turned out to be a much bigger year that you or anybody else anticipated just given the profitability of the base business. But 2015 is really shaping up to be a very big year with the hep C launch.","But as we move out beyond 2015 post the HCV launch, can you comment on the pace of earnings growth? Obviously with bio-similar competition towards the end of the decade for HUMIRA that is going to have an impact on your earnings growth. But will 2015 be a one-off year, or how should we think about the pace of earnings growth going forward?","And then a second question for you, Rick. We have a lot more information now about the hep C market. We now know the pricing of the new Gilead combo. We\u2019ve seen the spectacular initial launches of Sovaldi.","Can you comment on how I think early at one point you talked about achieving a 20% market share in this massive market, can you refresh us on your expectations just given how much more information we have now? Thanks very much.","Rick Gonzalez","Well Jami, this is Rick. So, first I\u2019d say on the expectations for \u201815 and beyond, obviously we\u2019re not going to give guidance out multiple years. But I think I can frame it this way for you.","If you look at what we expect to be able to deliver out of our pipeline including HCV and other assets like 199, we have a high level of confidence that we can continue to drive strong growth over the long-term.","As far as the bio-similar impact is concerned, obviously that\u2019s something we have looked at and we have carefully analyzed and we\u2019ve had now a number of years to put a strategy in place that we believe will protect in HUMIRA, through that period of time. And so we\u2019ve obviously modeled what that looks like and I can tell you we have confidence in what we can do in that area.","I\u2019m not going to give you a lot more specifics on that at this point. We\u2019ve described in detail what it looks like it is a combination of three major areas, product enhancements, both, formulation as well as device, intellectual property and commercial strategies. And this is a market we understand well. And as I said, I think we have planned this out very well.","And I think we have a high level of confidence in our ability to be able to execute that strategy in the face of bio-similar competition.","There will be a time where we can give you more color I know this isn\u2019t very satisfying to you. There will be a time where we can give you more color this just is not the time to be able to do that. We have to make sure that we have planned this out appropriately. And so, in the future we will be able to give you a little more detail around that.","As it relates to Hepatitis C, what I would tell you is this. If you look at the Hep C market and HCV for us, it\u2019s a very exciting opportunity. And I would tell you it\u2019s a very important opportunity for AbbVie. So, let me say, in the backdrop of we\u2019re getting very close to entering the U.S. market once we\u2019re approved, it wouldn\u2019t be prudent for us to provide a lot of specific details around our commercial strategy or go-to-market strategy.","But what I can do is I think frame for you, how we think about the competition in the marketplace, how we think about the marketplace. I\u2019m not going to provide an expectation at this point but I\u2019ll give you some perspective I think.","As we said many times before, we believe the clinical performance of our product across all patient types is very strong. And it\u2019s especially strong in the psoriatic and difficult to treat patients. And we believe that will be an important factor in how we compete in the marketplace. We believe relapse rates and SPRs are important.","We still don\u2019t believe that minor differences in pill count or shorter duration of therapy in certain patients will significantly change the competitive dynamics in this marketplace. In fact I tell you, in our interactions with many KOLs, they indicate that they\u2019re going with 12 weeks of therapy in patients to minimize the risk of relapse in those patients.","As far as the market is concerned to the point you made, we see the market as being even more attractive than we thought about it a year ago. It\u2019s certainly bigger than we thought, it\u2019s far more receptive to high curate therapies that are highly tolerable and the market wants alternatives, that\u2019s clear.","So, I can tell you, we feel very good about our ability to compete in this market and create meaningful share for our product. As I said, I\u2019m not going to go through a lot of specifics around the commercial strategy until we\u2019ve launched.","Last thing I\u2019d say is, as you know, the 2014 guidance we provided excludes any HCV revenues. So, it\u2019s not counting on any HCV revenues, whenever we get an HCV we\u2019ll obviously be upside.","But certainly when we provide 2015 guidance and product specific detail, at that point we will provide you with what our expectation is for HCV for 2015. Thanks.","Jami Rubin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks.","Larry Peepo","Thanks Jami, our next question please Elon.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yes. Thanks very much. So I missed a little bit of the call. I just wanted to ask a couple of questions about some of the select product upside. I guess specifically maybe you could just make an overall comment on whether inventory levels changed at AbbVie between the end of the second quarter and the end of the third quarter, i.e. was there a buy-in or buy-out for the company overall?","And then second, were there any buy-ins for any select products of note? And then third, with respect to Kaletra ex-U.S., I don\u2019t know if you commented but that was unusually strong. Could you just explain that revenue number in the quarter and what we should think about for the fourth quarter head sequentially? Thank you.","Bill Chase","David, its Bill Chase. So, inventory I\u2019ll discuss in really two different pieces. You\u2019ve got inventory at wholesalers and then obviously you\u2019ve got inventory in the retail chain. At the wholesale level, our inventories across all products in the U.S. was roughly consistent between quarter two and quarter three.","The retail channels are little tougher to call as you know. In Q2, we did see some speculative buying in advance of the price increase around HUMIRA. We think some of that buying came out in Q3, although obviously it didn\u2019t mute the overall performance of the brand to a meaningful extent. But in general, at the wholesale level everything was consistent quarter-to-quarter.","From a Kaletra ex-U.S. standpoint, that product is subject to some volatility based on tender timing. And you saw that in the third quarter. I think in the long-term outlook for this brand is probably somewhat negative from a single digit standpoint. So, I think what you\u2019re really seeing in Q3 was the anomaly of tenders internationally.","David Risinger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Got it. Thank you.","Larry Peepo","Thanks David. Elon, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Goodman from UBS.","Mark Goodman \u2013 UBS","Yes, I was hoping you could give us a flavor for how much of the, pre-spend for the HCV launch is already showing up in the quarter here? And how much additional we should be expecting in the fourth quarter and the first quarter? And then second, if you could just go through what data we will be seeing at ASH?","Bill Chase","So Mark, Bill Chase. We\u2019re not going to get into specific details on how much of the HCV investment we\u2019ve put in. Sufficed to say, we have obviously begun spending this year and you should expect that spending to increase sequentially in the fourth quarter and that\u2019s been reflected in the profile guidance we\u2019ve given.","Mark Goodman \u2013 UBS","Change in sales force, has that started already?","Bill Chase","Excuse me.","Mark Goodman \u2013 UBS","Sales force?","Bill Chase","We are all ready to go on HCV. We\u2019re just waiting approval.","Mark Goodman \u2013 UBS","So that is already reflected in the third quarter?","Bill Chase","It is.","Mike Severino","On your question regarding ASH, this is Mike Severino, I\u2019ll take the question regarding ASH. There is going to be a number of important presentations on ABT-199 or BCL-2 inhibitor. This includes initial single-agent data in AML. And we\u2019ll also provide a number of updates on our ongoing earlier studies, and update on our Rituxan plus 199 Study in CLL, including an update on patients who have stopped therapy.","And we\u2019re going to have first data on Chemo combination study bendamustine plus Rituxan plus 199 in non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma in DLBCL. And there will be a number of other updates including 199 and GA-101, and CLL from early phase studies.","Larry Peepo","Thanks Mark. Elon, we\u2019ll take our next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.","Jeff Holford \u2013 Jefferies","Hi. Thanks very much for taking my questions. So just on your HCV program you mentioned do you expect to bring a new \u2013 at any point into your next-generation program and give us any updates on how you think you might go about that if that is the case?","Secondly around margins, other results of some of the cost savings you would\u2019ve looked at as part of the Shire transaction going forward, did you see any opportunities in the base business going forward that you can look at for further margin enhancement?","And then just lastly, this will be for Rick, of course, are you concerned that by highlighting your underlying tax situation that you could have potentially made the company vulnerable to a takeover by a foreign company going forward? Thank you.","Rick Gonzalez","So, Mike, why don\u2019t you cover the first question?","Mike Severino","Sure. This is Mike Severino. With respect to our plans with hep C, we feel very good about both our current generation hep C program and our next-generation hep C program which is advancing very nicely to the clinic.","We\u2019re currently in Phase 2b studies with our next generation program. Back in mind is our next-generation protease inhibitor and our next-generation NS5A inhibitor. Things are progressing very well. We\u2019re going to continue to evaluate these data as they roll-out and we\u2019ll be providing updates and appropriate scientific settings over the course of the next year.","We\u2019re always looking at promising mechanisms in our early discovery efforts and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate those efforts in light of the clinical results as described as well.","Overall though, I feel very good the progress we\u2019re making in hep C. And I think we\u2019re going to have a compelling offering with first generation and it\u2019s an area that we\u2019re committed and it\u2019s an area that we\u2019ll remain active.","Bill Chase","Jeff, on cost savings, yes, I can tell you this is an organization that has always been focused on driving cost out of the business. I think you can see that to an extent on the progress we\u2019ve made on gross margin. And certainly we keep our eye open for those things all the time.","I think in 2015, if you look at some drivers behind the business, the dynamics trend favorably for operating margin expansion. Obviously the TriCor\/Trilipix LOE event is fully behind us at that point. You\u2019re seeing the efficiency efforts play out on gross margin. And we would obviously expect a strong positive impact of the HCV launch which offers both a high gross margin as well as SG&A profile improvement.","So, too early to get into a specific operating margin number for you for next year, but I\u2019m confident we\u2019re going to have a nice story to tell on this when we get into it next year.","Rick Gonzalez","And on your question about potentially being a takeover target, let me address it this way. If you look at our situation about offshore cash, we\u2019re certainly not unique in our industry in fact I\u2019d say we\u2019re pretty consistent with how our industry tends to operate. So I don\u2019t know that we flagged anything in the process.","But essentially I\u2019d tell you that our goal as a company is to stay a strong sustainable independent company. We\u2019ve demonstrated that we can drive strong shareholder value you see that in the GSR that we\u2019ve delivered, you see that in our market cap.","So I can tell you my focus is on driving the business at top-tier performance, building out a robust pipeline and delivering strong returns to shareholders.","My philosophy is if you do that well, the market will reward you both in your PE as well as your market cap. And that\u2019s the focus that we have for the business and that\u2019s what we pay attention to going forward.","Jeff Holford \u2013 Jefferies","Thanks very much.","Larry Peepo","Thanks Jeff. Elon, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Colin Bristow from Bank of America.","Colin Bristow \u2013 Bank of America","Good morning and congrats on the quarter. Just on hep C, arguably you\u2019re most competitive versus Harvoni in the treatment experience cirrhotics with the TURQUOISE-II data.","Given your excluded prior protease inhibitor patients, how should we be thinking about this from a labeling perspective and can tell you help us quantify the size of this population?","And then just a little more on the label. I know it is hard but how confident are you that you can get a 12-week label in the treatment experience cirrhotics and how important is this for you from a commercial perspective? It seems like the FDA has a very high bar for the SVR sacrifice versus duration of therapy? Thanks.","Rick Gonzalez","We\u2019re in the midst right now of dialog with the agency over labeling so we\u2019re not going to, it\u2019s not just appropriate to talk about a lot of the specifics that we\u2019re talking through with them.","I can tell you, we feel comfortable with our data set in cirrhotics and across all the other patients. We certainly feel comfortable when we look at our 12-week and 24-week data in cirrhotics, both have excellent SVR performance. And so, we don\u2019t feel at all uncomfortable with the direction that our labeling is going in.","PI failures.","Mike Severino","Yes. Treatment, this is Mike Severino, treatment regimens are obviously evolving considerably. I think that I would point to the overall breadth of our data both in cirrhotics and outside of cirrhotics, we feel very good with our profile we have, very high SVR, very high cure rates. And again, we feel very good about the profile that we see. I think that\u2019s probably it.","Colin Bristow \u2013 Bank of America","Thanks a lot.","Larry Peepo","Okay. Thanks Colin. Next question Elon.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Bill, could you please build on your earlier comments about gross margin. What specifically are these margin-enhancing initiatives that you are referring to?","And is this what we can expect going forward because we would only expect gross margin going up with hep C? And a follow-up, could you please give us an update about your efforts to simplify your current hep C regimen with fewer pills, please? Thank you.","Bill Chase","So, Alex, regarding the gross margin, there are a couple of things are in play on that line. First and foremost as you know we have obviously lost TriCor\/Trilipix which had a higher than average gross margin than the corporate rate. So that\u2019s some headwind we\u2019ve actually been facing over the last couple of years.","And you can see we\u2019ve negotiated that nicely. Offsetting that there has been a couple of things. First of all, there is an impact of product mix in pricing. But equally important there have been efforts that we\u2019ve put in place to reduce cost and that could be manufacturing cost, supply chain cost as well as of course to address some of our royalty burden on HUMIRA as well.","And you\u2019re seeing some of that play out this year. Next year obviously with HCV coming online, we would expect that to have a gross margin that would be higher than the corporate mix. And HUMIRA obviously has been performing very, very nicely as well and that ought to have a benefit on that line item as well.","Rick Gonzalez","Alex, this is Rick. You kind of broke off when you said the last question, but I think what you asked was what are we doing to work on simplifying the regimen for HCV, is that what you asked?","Alex Arfaei \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","That is correct, yes.","Rick Gonzalez","Okay. Well, let me start with what I commented on before. We don\u2019t believe the difference in pill burden is going to be a competitive disadvantage. So, first and foremost I\u2019d tell you that.","The second thing is we are working on some ways to be able to simplify our regimen with the current generation and that has continued to progress well. Next generation obviously has significant simplification associated with it as well, and that would be advancement as well.","So, we have an active program in both areas to move it forward. We\u2019re not at a point where we want to talk a lot about it beyond that but we are working on ways to simplify the regimen and continue to make sure that we\u2019re advancing the regimen.","This is a market that I can tell you we\u2019re absolutely committed to for the long-term. And obviously we\u2019re investing in a way to be able to continue to sustain our position in the market.","Larry Peepo","Thanks Alex. Next question please Elon.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","Hi guys, thanks a lot for taking the question.","Larry Peepo","Sure.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","Number one, do you guys happen to have data out there in the hep C it around how many patients are actually under the active care of a treating specialist, that is a data point that one of your competitors historically has provided and declined to provide in the most recent quarter, just wondering if you have a view on that?","And then number two on hep C, have you generated yet any data for your regimen in Victrelis or Incivek failures? And then finally on HUMIRA, could you just give us the year-on-year price versus volume change please? Thank you.","Rick Gonzalez","Thanks Mark. As far as the data of the number of patients under active care was specialist, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re talking about hepatologists and infectious disease specialists. Our people know that but to be honest with you, I don\u2019t know that number. Does anybody else in the room know that number?","Bill Chase","Yes, I don\u2019t think we have that on for you Mark.","Rick Gonzalez","So, maybe as a follow-up we\u2019ll try to provide that. I can tell you that as we\u2019ve geared up commercially, we obviously believe that it\u2019s important and I\u2019ve seen the numbers that a significant percentage of the patients are under the care of specialists.","But I\u2019d also tell you that based on the massive number of GI specialists, that\u2019s also an important commercial channel to cover. And we have scaled our sales force to cover both aspects of it, both specialists as well as GI physicians as well. But I don\u2019t remember Mark, the actual split between the two.","Bill Chase","Mark on HUMIRA, you really have a tail of really two different markets. In the U.S. we have typically been able to take some price along with the category. And if you really look at volume trend, script trends, which this quarter we\u2019re very, very strong. You can pretty much get back to the 25.3% growth on the quarter by looking at that strong TRX and really reconciling it back to the price increases we\u2019ve taken this year.","Ex-U.S., we typically see negative price so actually that\u2019s primarily more than 100% volume. On a total brand basis, yes, I think you can think of price this quarter netting out in the mid single-digits and the rest being volumes.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","And the PI failures?","Mike Severino","This is Mike Severino, with respect to data on PI failures, those aren\u2019t data that we\u2019ve generated yet, something that we would look at and maybe do it in the future.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","Thanks a lot.","Larry Peepo","All right, thanks Mark.","Operator","And our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve Scala \u2013 Cowen & Company","Thank you. I have two questions. First on hep C, AbbVie would appear to have a potential competitive advantage in the sickest patients where treatment to 12 weeks might be necessary and I know that AbbVie isn\u2019t going to reveal pricing today.","But given this possible competitive advantage, what are reasons that AbbVie would not price at a premium? Maybe you can provide at least one reason why AbbVie wouldn\u2019t price at a premium?","And then second, a bit of a broader issue, AbbVie has done a terrific job maintaining HUMIRA\u2019S position as the leading TNF despite very similar competitive products and very high price points. It seems that your competitors that sell basal insulins and inhaled asthma products could have learned from your strategies. But as managed care seems to be rotating among the big therapeutic categories and attempting to extract price, why won\u2019t we see this happen in TNFs? Thank you.","Rick Gonzalez","Okay, this is Rick. I\u2019ll try to answer two questions. Although I would say your first question basically asks me about our pricing strategy which I\u2019m not going to go into any detail.","But what I would say to you is, we looked very carefully at the overall market how our products would be positioned in that market, our ability to be able to take share. And we\u2019ve come up with the strategy that we believe optimizes our ability to take a meaningful share position.","We\u2019ve looked at alternatives that were different, some of which similar to what you described and some of which weren\u2019t similar to what you described. And so, we\u2019ve come up with what our commercial strategy will be and we\u2019re going to execute that upon launch of the product and the approval of the product. And at that point we\u2019ll provide you more color.","On HUMIRA and payer actions, what I would tell you is this we\u2019ve competed in this market for a long-long time. Obviously in the U.S. market the payer component is a very critical component. In scenario where we have good relationships with payers, there have been lots of competitive entrants into this market.","And I take predictions of HUMIRA\u2019s market share erosion and that hasn\u2019t occurred. And it\u2019s partially because if you look at the product and its ability to be able to perform clinically, if you look at the breadth of the menu of applications and indications that it has, that plays a very important role.","And so, I don\u2019t see the payer dynamic changing significantly in anti-TNS going forward. This has been a competitive market for many years now. And we\u2019ve done quite well in that market and there is always price pressure and you have to work through that in the appropriate way.","Larry Peepo","I would say Steve, this is Larry that we certainly feel good about how 2015 settles out for us with payers on HUMIRA.","Steve Scala \u2013 Cowen & Company","Thank you.","Larry Peepo","All right. Thanks Steve, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yes, thanks for taking the questions. A couple here. One, you recently announced this $5 billion buyback program. Can you just let us know if you\u2019ve already started executing on that program and if so how much buybacks have you completed this quarter?","I guess specifically I\u2019m just wondering in terms of your \u2013 what your share count expectations might be that are baked into your new 2014 earnings guidance and is it a very different number from what we saw at the end of the third quarter?","And the second one kind of following up on Chris\u2019s question earlier on M&A. You talked about size, can you talk a little bit about maybe therapeutic areas that might be of a priority now, for example rare diseases where Shire is obviously strong? Is that an area in particular that you may wish to invest more? Any thoughts around areas of investment would be helpful. Thanks.","Bill Chase","So, Vamil, obviously the quarter is not done yet, the fourth quarter that is. We do intend to when the year finishes, you\u2019ll see that we have repurchased shares that I can\u2019t give you exact guidance on what that number is going to be at this point in time.","Rick Gonzalez","Vamil, on the M&A strategy, this is Rick. I mean, I think if you look at what our strategy is for AbbVie, we want to build leadership positions in specially focused areas. If you look at what we\u2019re good at, what we\u2019re really good at is taking products that have strong clinical data and the decision making process is driven around clinical data and being able to \u2013 be able to go out and commercialize that effectively.","And so, we really have two primary goals, when we look at M&A. One is to build out those areas where we currently have leadership positions like immunology is an example. And other areas where we have leadership position, our goal is to try to restate standard care in those segments.","And in many cases, we\u2019re looking at multiple different mechanisms of action to be able to try to do that, standard of care restatement in the areas that we have leadership positions in.","And then we have areas where we have emerging strengths where we want to build out leadership positions and expand more aggressively, oncology is a good example. 199 and we believe will create a good anchor position for us in that market. AAA, 414, we have a number of assets coming behind them.","Certainly we would be interested in looking for more oncology assets. If there was the right kind of opportunity with on-market products in oncology and had some commercial infrastructure in place that would be attractive to us moving forward.","Rare diseases, is certainly a profile of the specialty market. It\u2019s consistent than what we look at. And I\u2019d hepatology is the other area that would be of strong interest. I\u2019m not giving you a complete list but I\u2019m giving you sort of the top of mind areas that we focus on.","Bill Chase","Vamil, one other thing, Bill Chase again. Just in the event that you\u2019re inferring something to your question. Our increase in the guidance for the year is purely based on the business fundamentals as we see them. We\u2019re not anticipating that being significantly moved by our buyback activity, just wanted to be clear on that.","Vamil Divan \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Rick Gonzalez","Thanks Vamil, and Elon, we have time for one more question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is from March Purcell from Barclays.","Mark Purcell \u2013 Barclays","Thanks for taking my question. On HUMIRA could you help us understand the benefit from the royalty roll-off in Q3 from the cessation of payments to Merck KGA I think was in June and how that schedule of roll-off changes going forward through the plan expiries in both U.S. and Europe?","Secondly, could you help us understand the size of the international shipment timing effect for HUMIRA in terms of how much growth it took off the ex-U.S. sales? Third, the IL-17 is about to launch in psoriasis, I think it is about 15% of HUMIRA sales. Could you help us understand the impact you feel those will have, or otherwise, on your business for next year?","And then lastly on debt $9 billion of long-term debt. Can you help us understand your plans to restructure that and that is with respect to potential capital employment going forward.","Bill Chase","So, Mark, on the dynamics in gross margin, I guess this is a simple way to think of that. We in the quarter had about 1-point headwind from related to TriCor\/Trilipix LOE event. Obviously we made that up and then some. Our ability to make that up was driven probably somewhat equally by product mix and cost efficiency as well as including royalty \u2013 the royalty stack.","I\u2019m not going to get into specifics on how much that royalty stack impacted it. What I can tell you though is it\u2019s not all royalty stack, we have a lot of activities going on right now, to streamline our supply chain and our overall manufacturing base.","In terms of adds the same plays out over the LRP, we\u2019ve never been specific on what the exact royalty stack is, some have estimated it\u2019s between 5% and 10%. We\u2019ve said those are good estimates. And one of the benefits of that royalty stack is, it will be largely removed at the point that we lose exclusivity on HUMIRA. So that\u2019s an important upside to the product when we come to that point in time.","In terms of the impact of international shipments on HUMIRA, obviously that puts some volatility quarter to quarter in the XUS HUMIRA number. This quarter it was about 1%, it wasn\u2019t huge.","Rick Gonzalez","Debt question.","Bill Chase","From a debt perspective, what I would tell you is we\u2019re pretty happy with our balance sheet right now. Obviously we\u2019re building cash, we\u2019re looking at ways to deploy that cash whether it be through M&A or giving it back to the shareholders as you\u2019ve seen in our recent announcements.","I don\u2019t think there is any compelling reason to necessarily reduce the amount of debt on our balance sheet. So, as those maturities come up, obviously we\u2019re looking to term those things up. But as whole, we think we\u2019ve got a very, very strong balance sheet.","Rick Gonzalez","This is Rick, on the IL-17 obviously we study every new mechanism that comes into this market and developer strategy to deal with that mechanism going forward. We understand the IL-17 very well and the data that we\u2019ve seen so far.","What I\u2019d tell you is if you look at many other mechanisms that have into all the different categories we compete in whether it\u2019s RA or GI or psoriasis, this is a tough market to break into and gain significant share because there is a reluctance to ultimately go to a new mechanism very quickly.","These are very potent drugs and have sometimes unknown side-effect profiles until there are in large populations. And that tends to make physicians more reluctant to switch in mass patients.","And so, we view IL-17 as a good mechanism, there is no question it\u2019s a good mechanism. And, but we view it early on it would be like other mechanisms that would come into this market, it will probably be more for failures, TNF failures, and eliminate some of that rotation that would have occurred. But we don\u2019t assume that is going to have a dramatic impact on our psoriasis share going forward.","Mark Purcell \u2013 Barclays","Thank you.","Larry Peepo","All right, thanks Mark.

Welcome to the AbbVie Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question and answer portion of this call. [Operation Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'm you may now begin.","Elizabeth Shea","Good morning and thank you for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Executive Vice President of Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer; and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I want to remind you that some statements made today are or may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.

AbbVie undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revision to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.","On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website.","Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.","Richard Gonzalez","Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I'll briefly discuss our fourth quarter performance and our 2016 operational highlights. Mike will then provide updates on recent advancements across our R&D efforts, and Bill will discuss the quarter and our 2017 guidance in more detail. As always following our remarks, we'll have an opportunity to take your questions.","We delivered another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share coming at the upper end of our guidance range, despite an unexpected negative impact of foreign exchange, demonstrating the strength of our overall business. Our adjusted earnings per share of $1.20 represented growth of 6.2% into the fourth quarter of 2015. Our performance in the quarter taps off another excellent year for AbbVie, for the full year we delivered more than 13% global operational sales growth and we increased our ongoing earnings per share by more than 12%.","In 2016, we drove strong commercial, operational and R&D execution, resulting in industry leading performance on both the top and bottom lines. AbbVie's EPS growth for 2016 ranks us among the top growth companies within our industry. We saw exceptional growth in HUMIRA, which drove 16% global operational growth in the year, including U.S. growth of 24% and international operational growth of 4.3%. Despite increase in competition from new classes of drugs and indirect biosimilar competition in international markets, HUMIRA remains the clear market leader and continues to perform very well across the rheumatology, dermatology in GI markets.","We also saw strong momentum in growth to IMBRUVICA with full year 2016 sales in excess of $1.8 billion, a 67% increase over the prior year. We're continuing to drive strong uptake in CLL, our market segment that represents the largest revenue contributor IMBRUVICA's growth over our long-range plan, and major growth opportunity for the Company. We also continue to advance our clinical development efforts in other blood cancers, supporting robust long-term growth of the brand. Further expansion into NHL and other indications represents another major growth driver of IMBRUVICA. We continue to remain excited about the vast potential for this unique asset.","Global Viekira performance which was below our original expectations generated over $1.5 billion in the year, and we had continued strong performance from other products within our portfolio. Over the past year, we've seen significant pipeline advancement and achieved a number of important developments and regulatory milestones. We've received approvals for several assets IMBRUVICA and first-line CLL including a label with overall survival data Venclexta and relapsed\/refractory CLL with patients with 17p deletion; Zinbryta for relapsing\/remitting multiple sclerosis; and HUMIRA for uveitis, our 10th HUMIRA indication in U.S.","We successfully completed registrational studies and submitted regulatory application for a number of key pipeline assets, including our pan-genotypic, next generation HCV therapy and IMBRUVICA in marginal zone lymphoma which received FDA approval last week. We also reported compelling data from several mid-and late-stage development programs that Mike is going to discuss in just a few moment.","The progress we made with our pipeline including the data we share over the past year has further increased our level of confidence and de-risked many of our key R&D programs. Nemours assets in our late stage pipeline have the opportunity to generate multibillion dollar peak year sales and represent an opportunity for meaningful revenue growth in the years to come. We expect to see a significant number of regulatory and clinical mile stones for these assets in 2017, which again Mike will discuss in more detail.","In 2016, we also augmented our portfolio and our pipeline through strategic licensing and acquisition activity. In June, we completed our acquisition of Stemcentrx, providing AbbVie an exciting late stage asset in Rova-T as well as the highly attractive discovery and early development platform. Rova-T represents a significant market opportunity as we advance in the first-line small cell lung cancer and other indications. In addition to Rova-T, the acquisition of Stemcentrx also brought with it a pipeline of additional clinical development programs, including four additional novel compounds currently in human trials, covering solid tumor from small lung cancer to ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer among other.","We announced the collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim to develop and commercialize risankizumab, an anti-IL 23 monoclonal antibody that has the potential to be a transformative therapy in a number of immune mediated diseases. We've entered 2017 with strong momentum, and we're committed to delivering strong results. Our full year 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $5.44 to $5.54 positioned AbbVie to be among the industries leaders for EPS growth once again this year. We also continue to track towards delivering our long-term objectives, which will generate double digit EPS growth on average through 2012, putting AbbVie in a very tough of our peer group.","So, in summary, we're pleased with our execution and performance, and we delivered an outstanding return of our shareholders. We've also demonstrated a strong track record of managing and overcoming challenges while still delivering on our expectations. We've established sustainable leadership positions in some of the largest and most attractive market segments, and we've built the compelling de-risk pipeline within these areas, which is poised to fuel long term growth.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?","Michael Severino","Thank you, Rick. In 2016, we significantly advanced and de-risked our pipeline and achieved a number of important regulatory mile stones. And we expect 2017 to be a very productive year as well with a potential for several regulatory submissions and approvals. Key data read outs and important phase transitions. Today, I'll highlight recent pipelines updates and discuss some of the mile stones we anticipate in the year to come. I'll start with oncology, an area where we are advancing our pipeline in both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.","In the area of hematologic oncology, we continue to make significant progress with both IMBRUVICA and Venclexta. Since our last earnings call at the end of October, we along with our partner Janssen received approval for test of IMBRUVICA, as a chemotherapy free option for patients with marginal zone lymphoma who have failed prior therapies. With the approval coming two months ahead of the PDUFA date, this marks the seventh FDA approval and fifth major indication for IMBRUVICA. Currently, there are no other approved therapies specifically indicated for MZL, making IMBRUVICA the first FDA-approved treatment for this disease.","We also received conditional approval of Venclexta in Europe for the treatment of CLL patients with the 17p deletion or TP53 mutation, as well as in CLL patients who have failed the chemotherapy and a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor regardless of their mutational status. We along with our partner Roche Genentech are pleased to be able bring this new treatment option to patients in more countries around the world.","At the recent ASH meeting, we presented data from 25 abstracts evaluating use of our portfolio blood cancer medicines. This included results from several studies to valuating IMBRUVICA across a number of hematology malignancies including long-term data in patients with CLL showing at nearly 9 out of 10 patients achieved complete or partial response at the five year mark. These data demonstrate the promise that IMBRUVICA holds as a CLL treatment that can offer a long-term progression free and overall survival.","In addition, we presented favorable efficacy and safety data in two common types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma as well as new Phase 2 data in marginal zone lymphoma demonstrating the nearly half of patients with relapsed\/refractory MCL respond to treatment with IMBRUVICA. And we also presented data in chronic graft versus host disease demonstrating complete or partial response in two-thirds of patients.","For Venclexta, we presented data in a range of tumor types including Phase 1 safety and efficacy data in both, AML and multiple myeloma as well as results from mid-stage studies in follicular lymphoma and diffused large B-cell lymphoma. This coming year, there will be several key data readouts from our hematologic\/oncology portfolio that could enable registration of both IMBRUVICA and Venclexta in new indications. For IMBRUVICA, we anticipate data from an interim analysis in front-line mantle cell lymphoma later this year as well as additional potential interim analysis in other forms of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.","Later this quarter, we expect to submit our U.S. regulatory application for the use of IMBRUVICA in patients with chronic graft versus host disease who failed prior systemic therapy. Chronic GVHD is a serious and debilitating complication of stem cell or bone marrow transplantation and with no approved therapies for the disease, there is a significant unmet medical need. We are also making progress in a number of important studies evaluating IMBRUVICA monotherapy and combination therapy versus regimen such as BR and FCR, often considered the gold standards in the treatment of CLL.","In addition, studies are being run in different patient segments including young and fit patients and the watch and wait population. The results of these studies will add significantly to the breadth of data supporting IMBRUVICA, providing physicians more evidence of its compelling clinical benefits in the front-line setting. For Venclexta, we're expecting data from the MURANO study later this year, which we believe will support a broader label in relapsed\/refractory CLL.","Last year, we received approval for Venclexta's first indication as monotherapy in patients with relapsed\/refractory CLL and the 17p deletion mutation, a small but medically important segment of the CLL market and an important first step for this exciting new treatment. Also last year, Venclexta received its third breakthrough therapy designation for use in untreated AML patients who are ineligible to receive standard induction with high-dose chemotherapy, and we recently began our Phase 3 program in AML. We look forward to additional data readouts and regulatory approvals for Venclexta in the coming years.","I'll now turn to our solid tumor programs where we continue to make good progress with our late stage programs for Rova-T, Veliparib and ABT-414 as well as with our early stage oncology pipeline. In the Rova-T program, we expect to report data from the TRINITY study in the second half of the year with regulatory submission following soon thereafter.","Additionally, in the latter part of the year, there is the potential for initial data from our basket study where we are evaluating Rova-T in a number of neuroendocrine tumors. We're also making good progress advancing new Stemcentrx assets into the clinic. As we expect to see up to four additional novel assets enter the clinic this year, adding to our portfolio of five clinical stage Stemcentrx program already underway.","We've also continued to make progress with our other pipeline assets targeting solid tumors including our PARP inhibitor, Veliparib and ABT-414 an antibody drug conjugate for glioblastoma multiforme. In 2017, we are expecting to see data from three Phase 3 studies of Veliparib, conducted a new neoadjuvant breast cancer in both the squamous and non-squamous forms of non-small cell lung cancer. We are also expecting to see data in the second half of this year for ABT-414 and second line glioblastoma multiforme, the most common and most aggressive type of malignant primary brain tumor. These trial results if positive would support regulatory submissions.","In our early stage oncology pipeline, we are continuing to explore new technologies that will extend our reach into the solid tumor market. For example, our next generation immuno-oncology programs are designed to broaden and deepen responses beyond what has been with the first way of IL therapies. We\u2019re using novel approaches including our bispecific technology to elicit T-cell activation in close proximity to tumor cells. Over the next 12 months, we expect to have as many as five next generation immuno-oncology assets in the clinic, which adds to our growing oncology pipeline of more than 35 late preclinical or clinical stage assets.","Moving now to our immunology program, where we continue to make great progress with our two late-stage assets, risankizumab and ABT-494, both of which are tracking ahead of our initial development timelines. Risankizumab, our anti-IL 23 monoclonal antibody license from Boehringer Ingelheim has the potential to be a transformative therapy in a number of immune-mediated diseases, by providing best in category efficacy and increased dosing convenience with quarterly administration. Risankizumab is currently in Phase 3 development psoriasis with mid-stage trials ongoing in both Crohn's diseases and psoriatic arthritis. The risankizumab Phase 3 program in psoriasis continues to progress well, and we expect to see data from three of the pivotal studies later this year with commercialization expected in 2019.","This year, we will also see a number of additional data readouts and important phase transitions for the risankizumab, including Phase 2 data in Crohn's disease, which is successful with trigger the start of the Phase 3 program later this year as well as Phase 2 data in psoriatic arthritis with Phase 3 studies expected to begin in the first half of 2018.","Additionally, we are expecting to begin a Phase 2 study for risankizumab in ulcerative colitis in the second half of the year. Our selective JAK-1 inhibitor, ABT-494, is currently in Phase 3 development for RA and has the potential to be best-in-class with we believe will be an optimized benefit risk profile. This program is progressing ahead of schedule, and we will begin to see some data from the Phase 3 RA program later in the year.","We are particularly excited about this assets potential in the difficult-to-treat anti-TNF and adequate responder population, a growing segment of the RA market representing roughly 35% of the biologic treated patient population. The development program for ABT-494 in gastrointestinal disorders is also progressing well, with the Phase 2 study in Crohn's disease ongoing and a Phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis, getting underway in the third quarter. Data from the Crohn's study should be available in the first half of 2017, with Phase 3 Crohn's studies starting later in the year.","We also recently began a Phase 2 study to evaluate our oral selective JAK-1 inhibitor in atopic dermatitis, which is expected later in the year. We continue to advance our early stage immunology pipeline as well with clinical programs recently initiated or expected to begin very soon for several key early stage assets, including our ROR\u03b3t inverse agonists, our anti-TNF-Steroid ADC, our CD-40 antagonist and our JAK BTK inhibitor combination.","Moving now to Virology where our emphasis is on addressing the remaining unmet medical need for our pan-genotypic next generation HCV regimen. We believe this objective can be accomplished with our once-daily oral combination of two novel antiviral that has demonstrated cure rates approaching 100% across genotypes with just eight weeks of therapy for the majority of patients.","Last month, we filed our regulatory submissions in both the U.S. and Europe. Our U.S. application was submitted under breakthrough designation and the EU submission was granted accelerated assessment. We're on track to launch this new regimen in both the U.S. and EU later in the year, and we're also on track to submit our regulatory application in Japan later this quarter.","In the area of women's health we're nearing completion of our Phase 3 program for Elagolix in endometriosis. Later in the year, we expect full data from both Phase 3 endometriosis studies including extension data, and also plan to submit our U.S. regulatory application in the third quarter.","We remain excited about this potential new medicine for women with this highly prevalent condition with their few effective treatment options. In addition to endometriosis program, we have Phase 3 studies underway in uterine fibroids, and we anticipate beginning to see data from that program towards the end of this year.","And lastly, in the area of neuroscience where we're focused on developing disease modifying therapies to treat neurodegenerative conditions, we recently began Phase 2 study in Alzheimer's disease and PSP with our anti-tau antibody. We see significant potential in tau-based approaches for delaying the progression of neurodegenerative diseases and look forward to one day being able to bring new treatment options to patients with these debilitating conditions.","So, in summary, we continue to see significant evolution of our mid-and late-stage pipeline programs over the past year, and 2017 promises to be another very productive year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our fourth quarter and full year performance.","Bill?","William Chase","Thanks Mike. This morning, I'll review the highlights of our full year 2016 performance, provide an overview of our fourth quarter, and then walk through our outlook for 2017.","We had another year of outstanding performance delivering top and bottom line growth in 2016 that is among the highest in our industry. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.82, up more than 12% compared to 2015. For the full year, adjusted net revenues were $25.6 billion. As you aware in November, we saw a strengthening of the dollar which drove higher than expected negative foreign exchange in the quarter, additionally continued competitive dynamics in the HCV market had an impact on IMBRUVICA sales.","As a result, sales for the year and the quarter came in at the lower end of our expected range. Despite these dynamics, full year sales growth was 13.3% on an operational basis, and we exceeded our EPS guidance for the year. Total adjusted net revenues for the fourth quarter were $6.8 billion, up 6.9% operationally excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange. HUMIRA delivered another quarter of strong growth with global sales of $4.3 billion, up 16.2% operationally. In the U.S. HUMIRA sales increased 23.5% compared to the prior year driven by volume growth of roughly 14% plus price. Wholesaler inventories remain below half a month in the quarter.","International HUMIRA sales were more than $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 4.1% on an operational basis and in line with our expectations. For the full year 2016, global HUMIRA sales were $16.1 billion reflecting incremental sales of more than $2 billion. Full year sales of HUMIRA in the U.S. grew more than 24% with mid-teens prescription growth and a contribution from price in the high-single digits. International HUMIRA operational sales growth for the full year was 4.3% consistent with our expectations of mid-single digit growth.","Excluding the impact of conditions in Venezuela, operational sales growth for the full year was approximately 7%. We continue to see good growth despite the entry of indirect biosimilar competition in the international markets. This exceptional performance was driven by HUMIRA's overall level of efficacy and safety, long physician experience and continued biologic penetration across disease categories. Its unique product profile and AbbVie's strong commercial execution has made HUMIRA the number one prescribed biologic, and it remains the undisputed market leader despite competition.","Global IMBRUVICA net revenues in the fourth quarter were $511 million, up 49% over the fourth quarter of last year driven by strong prescription growth trends. For the full year, IMBRUVICA sales exceeded $1.8 billion in line with our previously communicated guidance.","Global Viekira sales in the fourth quarter were $311 million, down versus the prior year and below our expectations. As we have previously communicated, we have seen market share loss and price erosion due to competitive dynamics within the HCV market.","Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease grew 26.7% on an operational basis in the quarter, and we also saw strong operational sales growth in the quarter from Creon which is up nearly 15%.","Turning to the P&L profile for the quarter, adjusted gross margin was 81% of sales. On a comparative year-over-year basis, this ratio reflects an adverse impact from foreign exchange of roughly a 150 basis point. In addition, adjusted gross margin reflects 50 basis points of unfavorable impact related to partnership accounting, equalizing for these impacts, the gross margin profile improved by approximately 250 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted R&D was 17.3% of sales in support of ongoing programs in oncology, immunology, HCV and other areas.","Adjusted SG&A was 23.9% of sales in the fourth quarter and operating margin profile was impacted by R&D investment related to Stemcentrx and risankizumab as well as the adverse impact to foreign currency, equalizing for these impacts, adjusted operating margin profile improved by 250 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted net interest expense was $251 million and the adjusted tax rate was 20.2% in the quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share excluding non-cash intangible amortization expense and other specified item was $1.20 up 6.2% year over year.","As we look ahead to 2017, we expect full year adjusted EPS of $5.44 to $5.54, reflecting growth of 13.9% at the midpoint. This guidance excludes $0.89 per share of non-cash amortization and other specified items. On the top line, we expect revenue of approximately 10% on an operational basis. Holding exchange rates constant at current levels, we would expect foreign currencies have a 1% unfavorable impact on reported sales growth. Included in our top line guidance, our assumptions for our key products as follows, in 2017 we expect tumor to once again be an important contributor to our performance with mid-to high-teens growth expected in the U.S. Internationally, we are forecasting mid-single digit operational growth, if currencies hold constant with current raters reported growth would be in the low-single digits.","For IMBRUVICA, we expect global revenues to AbbVie of greater than $2.4 billion with sales in the U.S. of more than $2 billion. We anticipate global Viekira of approximately $1 billion in 2017, while we are on track to launch our next generation HCV therapy later this year, based on a timing of managed care contracting cycles, we don\u2019t expect to see meaningful sales contributions until 2018.","Regarding AndroGel, we are forecasting 2017 sales of roughly $500,000. For Creon, we expect mid-to high-single digit sales growth. For Venclexta, we expect sales of approximately $125,000 million in 2017. As we previously communicated, our initial indication for Venclexta relapsed\/ refractory CLL patients with the 17p deletion addresses a $300,000 million market where IMBRUVICA currently holds more than 50% of the market share. Between both assets, we will hold a strong market leadership position in this segment. For Lupron, Synagis and Synthroid, we expect sales to be roughly flat year-over-year.","Regarding the P&L for 2017, we are forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio roughly flat to 2016 inclusive of the dilutive impact of our partner products on gross margin. We expect 2017 to be a year of significant R&D investment as we provide the appropriate level of funding across our pipeline in order to fuel our future growth. This includes the incremental funding and budget annualization associated with this Stemcentrx and risankizumab programs. As a result, we are forecasting adjusted R&D expense of approximately 17% of sales. We expect adjusted SG&A to approach 21% of sales reflecting the benefit of sales leverage.","In 2017 we are forecasting an adjusted operating margin profile of approximately 43% inclusive of the annualization of Stem and BI transactions. We remain committed to achieving the operating margin profile improvements that we have communicated in our long range guidance. We are forecasting adjusted net interest expense of approximately $1 billion for the full year, and we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 19.5% to 20% in 2017.","Regarding our first quarter outlook, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $1.24 and $1.26. Our first quarter adjusted EPS guidance excludes roughly $0.23 of non-cash amortization and other specified items. We are forecasting revenue growth in the first quarter to approach 10% operationally. Holding exchange rates constant and current levels, we would expect foreign exchange to have unfavorable impact on reported sales growth of approximately 1%. For U.S. HUMIRA, we expect sales growth in the first quarter to exceed 20% over the prior year, and we expect U.S. IMBRUVICA sales in the first quarter to grow in the high-single digits sequentially over the fourth quarter.","In closing, we're very pleased with AbbVie's strong performance in the quarter and the full year. We've driven strong top tier revenue and EPS growth while also advancing our strategic priorities and our pipeline. And we're well positioned for strong growth again in 2017.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call for questions. Operator, we'll take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs. Your line now is open.","Jami Rubin","Thank you. I guess my first question is for you, Bill. On operating margins, we didn't see leverage this year in large part because of R&D expenses, and when we think about 2017, continued pressure on R&D as you are making significant investments from the partnership programs. But I think that the Company gave long-term guidance of operating margins approaching 50%. I'm looking at other companies that have a similar mix as you do, like Amgen; they have over 50% operating margins. You are well below that. Can you talk about how we should think about the evolution of operating margins going forward? Because the partnership -- IMBRUVICA will continue to put pressure on gross margins; how we think about that. And R&D as a percentage of sales, should that stay in the 17% of sales range? And how should we think about you guys getting to a 50% operating margin? Because that's a long ways away from where we are right now. Then I have a follow-up question for you, Rick. Just if you could comment on FDA's interchangeability guidance. Anything that surprised you, anything that gives you pause in terms of timing, and in terms of impact to the HUMIRA franchise once biosimilars come to the market. Thanks.","William Chase","On your operating margin question, first of all, I think we've made enormous progress on operating margin, if you look at where we've come since spin-off, and we certainly did last year in the third quarter -- or I'm sorry, 2015 in the third quarter communicate our intent to hit 50% by 2020. Everything as we look at it right now is still on that plan. Obviously, we're in the process of pulling the other new LRP, and we're going to look at it again, but that's our goal as a management team and we certainly are constructing a path to get there.","If you look at '17 relative to '16, we're showing improvement. We had said in our long range guidance that we'd anticipate 100 to 200 basis improvements per year; it is true in '17 we're coming up a little shot of that. But you've to recognize that the annualization of Stem and BI as well as the required investment on those programs has pretty much added about a 120 basis points of dilution. So, if you back that out we would back within that range and what we communicated back at the end of '16 before we did Stem and BI. So, we think it's -- the base business is showing the right level of performance, and obviously we're having the opportunity to invest in those two very important programs and still deliver operating margin expansion. So, we're quite pleased with the number in '17.","In terms of how we get to 2020 target of 50%, you have to recognize that we first and foremost have the royalty stack on HUMIRA rolling off, that will have impact on the P&L in '18 and '19, just as we've communicated before but to remind you that royalty stack is 5% to 6% of global HUMIRA sales to one-third of the stack disappears at the end of '17 with P&L benefit in '18, two-thirds at the end of '18, P&L benefit in '19. So that will give you some idea of how that flows in, and then we are always committed to driving more efficient supply chain. We're enjoying those benefits right now and we have enjoyed them since then as well as other cost containment programs.","We have pretty I'd say strong targets internally to deliver on those, and then finally you can't overlook the importance of sales leverage across this P&L. Most notably '18 and beyond as we start launching new products, and we start getting the full indication to lead Venclexta, and again obviously HUMIRA in the U.S., we anticipate growth throughout that period. So, when you add all of those things up, even despite partnership accounting which we think will present about 200 basis points of drag. We feel that we got enough positives in the mix to drive that share -- of that operating margin profile goal.","Richard Gonzalez","Good morning, Jamie, it's Rick. So, interchangeability, I think as we all know the FDA has communicated for some time that they were going to come out with this guidance by the end of '16, so I think the timing of it was, was as expected. We got a chance to go through it, I think it clearly reflects that interchangeability is a higher standard than biosimilarity, it describes that biosimilars will have to do a three-way switching study between the biosimilar and the innovator, and it strongly suggests that those studies be done with U.S. reference products, as the comparator.","I'd also say that FDA devoted a considerable amount of time in the guidance to packaging and the delivery system or the device differences and potentially depending upon what those differences are, it could require a human factor studies in order to demonstrate that there's no significant difference between the biosimilar and the innovator's product. So, I think as we step back and we\u2019re continuing to obviously analyze this, when direct biosimilars come into the marketplace, we\u2019ve said that our strategy will be a strategy that's designed to maintain market share while maximizing the profitability of the brand. That remains the same, and I think unlike small molecules where the erosion curve is really driven by retail pharmacy substitution which is what makes it so challenging.","On a small molecule very little or almost none of biologics go through retail pharmacy, they go through and are dispensed through specialty pharmacy where your formulary position is really what dictates what product is dispensed, not the individual pharmacy. So, I don\u2019t think it fundamentally changes that part of the strategy. As far as the competitive dynamics, I think it's too early, I mean we don\u2019t believe based on what we know that any of the single-switch studies they're being done now would meet the standard. But we'll have to see how the competitive dynamics play out as people look at this and start to design programs in order to try to achieve interchangeability and so, and it will need to see how that plays out over time.","Jami Rubin","Can you just, Rick, throw out a guesstimate as to when you would expect an interchangeable biosimilar to be introduced to the market?","Richard Gonzalez","Well that's probably not something I just want to guess on. Yes, obviously, there are significant issues that play through your question. First and foremost, it's one of the biosimilars on the market to begin from a standpoint of our IP protection, and we remain committed to the position that we took back in 2015 that we believe our portfolio of IP will protect HUMIRA within the U.S. until 2022. And so beyond that, it's difficult for me to project based on where we are today, because I am not aware of anyone doing a study that would be compliant with what's described here. That doesn\u2019t mean it does not happen, it's just I am not aware of it.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Jeffrey Holford of Jefferies. Your line now is open.","Jeffrey Holford","Rick, I wonder if you could just comment with your thoughts around pricing exposure for your company with regard to every single time we get a tweet or a comment out the new government here, the new president, your stock does seem to get impacted the most of those amongst your peer group. Can you just talk about what you see as some of the biggest potential issues that could get discussed, whether it's dual eligibles or direct price negotiation and just how exposed you think your company is relative to others? The second question is on IMBRUVICA. Just Q4 just seemed a little light in the U.S. just against the volume trend. Can you just let us know if there's any factor there, like destocking, that impacted in quarter at all? Then just lastly, we are all expecting HUMIRA biosimilars in 2018 -- October 2018, I think is the date that we are mostly all looking at -- but you only give us HUMIRA numbers ex-U.S. So can you just help us at all; geographically, what's the mix of exposure in the territories from 2018 October in what you would expect biosimilars to be in the market ex-US and what percentage you wouldn't? Thank you.","Richard Gonzalez","All right. So, Jeff, maybe let me talk a little bit about pricing or reforms in the Affordable Care Act, there obviously are a lot of things out in the environment slowing around but there is not a lot of specificity yet. So, it's probably one difficult and two an appropriate for me to try to speculate on what some other changes might be. I think as we look at our business and the mix of our business, certainly, we are being conscious of pricing our products and way that is responsible and you have seen that. I think what is important for all of us in the innovation pharmaceutical space is to continue to demonstrate the value of the medicines that we have.","And in many cases as you know, these medicines actually reduce overall healthcare class and pharmaceuticals are still a relatively more percentage of the overall spend within the healthcares system the Medicare system. Specifically when we look at our business, I think most of our medicines are underpinned by strong evidence base that they're not only clinically very important and very effective, but also provided good economic value proposition for the system itself and we see that in the usage that get and fully socialized systems where they can determine, what products they use into the extent of that they use those systems. You see products like HUMIRA do extremely well in those markets.","Additionally, if you look at our business overall, it's not heavily weighted towards Medicare that only about 12% of our total revenues going to Medicare. So, we are not overly, heavily weighted within that sector. But I would say while our goal will be is to continue to advocate for access to innovative medicines for all patients, across all the channels, and I would hope that one of the things that as we look at reforming the Affordable Care Act that we could deal with, is the burden that donor hold and copays put on seniors in the Medicare program because I think that creates a lot of the challenge that we see. So, we'll have to see how it plays out. I mean I think some of the effort in this area I think, will benefit over the long haul that we've to see some more of the details.","So, on IMBRUVICA if you actually look at IMBRUVICA, it continues to perform extremely well. And global sales were $511 million in the quarter. The U.S. was 434; that's up about 47% year-over-year. Full year we were above the guidance that we gave, slightly above the guidance we gave of $1.8 billion, that represents 67% growth. If you look at the IMS prescription growth, it's up 38% in the quarter versus the prior year, and if you look quarter-to-quarter it's up about 6%, which we think is more indicative of the growth of the brand. That was if you look at just pure revenue in the two quarters, that was about $15 million or $20 million with a channel or inventory that occurred in the third quarter, the depressed revenues in the fourth quarter.","So that's essentially what you see when you look at the sequential growth quarter-to-quarter; as we look at fourth quarter as Bill mentioned in his comments, we're forecasting sequential growth in the high single-digit range -- I'm sorry in the first quarter in the high single-digit range. But it's overall we're very pleased with how IMBRUVICA is going, it continues to track where we had hoped or slightly ahead. So, we're very comfortable with IMBRUVICA.","And then you're last question is on the mix of biosimilar impact outside the U.S., actually for the vast majority of our countries, the fourth quarter of 2018 is the time at which biosimilars will be able to enter the marketplace, and as far as the geographic mix. That'll be driven by the competitors; how they launch, when they get access? Maybe one other things, that would be indicative or least directionally helpful is to look at the biosimilars that are in the marketplace today. So, if you look at the Remicade biosimilar, I think they're in about 66 countries today, at least 50 countries have reimbursement or pricing for those biosimilars.","They have about just under 5% of the overall market and they have about just under 25% of the molecule share, after being on the market for several years. If we look at the Enbrel biosimilar which has only been in the market for a shorter period of time; today they're approved in about 34 countries, they're pricing in 19 countries -- pricing reimbursement in 19 countries. The latest data says that they had just over 3% share of the overall category and about 14% or 15% share of the molecule.","So, I think directionally that gives you a feel for how it will probably roll out, that's consistent with what we had assumed when we provided guidance back in 2015 when we described to you what we thought the erosion curve would look like. We continue to monitor this and we feel comfortable with what erosion curve continues to look like.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Your line now is open.","Chris Schott","Great, thanks so much for the question, just had two here. First, can you elaborate on your HUMIRA volume expectations in the U.S. for 2017? It looks like another very strong year of growth again. Can you talk a little bit about price versus volume mix? And then which indications in particular are driving the growth for this year? My second question was a higher level one on immunology. You obviously have a very significant position with HUMIRA. You've got two important late-stage assets with the JAK and the IL-23, but it does seem like the competitive pressures in this space are growing. We've got new mechanisms. We've got biosimilars ex-US. We've got what seems like increased payer focus on the category. So how do you see that all playing out going forward? And do you think there's any risk that we see something similar happen here that has happened to diabetes, where we get more restricted formularies, we get more intense competition among the various players? I guess some high-level thoughts on how you see that space playing out. Thank you.","Richard Gonzalez","Okay. So, maybe I'll cover most of this and then Bill you can talk a little bit about the mix. I mean, if you look at HUMIRA maybe first on the competitive standpoint, this has been a highly competitive category for us quite some time. I mean I think there's something like 14 different mechanism, there were 10 or so for the last four or five years. It's really driven by -- the growth in this category is really driven by the performance of the brand, the breadth of the brand, the safety and efficacy of the brand, and the overall growth in biologic penetration that the underlying market continues to grow. I don't see those dynamics changing. Certainly, there's been a lot of discussion around the competitive nature of this market.","We certainly operate in a competitive environment. We work very closely with payers to ensure that we\u2019re striking the right balance. We've obviously negotiated all of our managed care contracts for 2017 and maybe even for 2018 as well, so I don\u2019t see anything on the horizon today that would give me pause as to the fundamental trajectory of HUMIRA, and as I step back, the U.S. where we probably have the best market share data. If you look at our market share overall it's increased slightly, rheumatology has increased the most and it\u2019s the largest category, we're up about a half a point overall. In rheumatology, we're roughly flat in derm and GI. One of the most important leading indicators for your growth is what your first line share is doing.","So, if you look at RA, our first line share's about 40%, if you look at psoriasis as an example our first line share, if you include Otezla, it's just under 40%, And if you exclude Otezla which really competes in the mild to moderate, not where we compete then it\u2019s just under 60%. So, very significant first-line share, and then if you look at GI between Crohn's and UC, our first-line share is about 55%. And so we continue to see very strong performance based on both our execution and obviously the performance of the brand. So, I'd say we have a high level of confidence in how HUMIRA's going to perform going forward. Bill, anything you want to add?","William Chase","So, Chris, picking up from there, obviously our guidance on HUMIRA in the U.S. is mid-high-teens and I think the way you want to think about that is continued volume in low double digits, high single digits. Price will have more of an impact earlier in the year and that's why we are guiding first quarter above 20% and then but we expect that volume to remain low double digit throughout the year.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Marc Goodman of the UBS. Your line now is open.","Marc Goodman","In the past you've talked about the amount of SG&A spend you have done on HUMIRA. Can you just give us an update on where that is for 2016? And then second, for M&A, Stemcentrx was a platform deal. Are you looking for more platform-type deals or should we be expecting more of these BI one-off type product deals as you look at M&A this year? Thanks.","Michael Severino","So, Marc, I'll pick up SG&A on HUMIRA. There is really the nothing about that business that has been negative and we will lead us to pull back on SG&A. Now, obviously, we are thoughtful, when we had the discussion about SG&A on HUMIRA, we said that largely the required base was in place. Obviously, though, we do have things like merit, inflation those sorts of things when we are always looking for ways to make our spent more efficient, but there is nothing about that the performance of the brand that will pull back on SG&A. I think it's also important to recognize that we have a pretty sophisticated rigorous process of evaluating ROI on every one of our SG&A program, and certainly if you look at the growth that HUMIRA has contributed in the quarter and the year and forecasted in 2017. And you can see why we will be confident that ROI is still holding up and that investment as wise.","Richard Gonzalez","As far as transactions or acquisitions or licensing opportunities, I mean you continue to active, but as we said when we did the Stem transaction for the next year or half from that point we said we wouldn\u2019t be looking for any kind of platform any kind of transaction it would be more individual products. I mean what really drives our efforts here is the strategy we have within each one of the verticals. We have a very specific set of price area would an each one of those verticals of assets that we are looking for. And as we signed those kinds of opportunities then obviously we purse those opportunities it\u2019s a today we don\u2019t view that we need any kind of a platform play or technology within any of those verticals and so I think you can assume more individual products whether they be straight at acquisition or such structure that is more similar today to the IL23 transaction that we did. I think that\u2019s what you should expect.","Operator","Next question is from Gregg Gilbert of Deutsche Bank. Your line now is open.","Gregg Gilbert","Rick, back on the subject of price, we are hoping you could clarify whether your pledge to stick to single-digit price increases also means just one per year. And do you agree with some of your peers' beliefs that the U.S. system is broken as it relates to the subject of list price versus actual net price growth? And shifting over to Mike, I was hoping you could share a little bit more color about your Phase 2 Alzheimer's compound. I realize it's early, but when will you learn something more meaningful that would inform your willingness to move it ahead? Is it final Phase 2 data or are there other sort of key break points within then that we could hear about in the next year or two? Thanks.","Rick Gonzalez","So on price as I communicated in our talk at JPMorgan's convention, we will only do one price per year and all brands will be under double digit so all increases will be single-digits and so we'll only do one. So we've obviously done one our rate on most assets and that will be it for the remainder of the year. On the system been broken, if you look at this -- I don't know if the system is broken, I think the perception that list price increases are what the -- is what gets passed along to the patients in the way of cost, it -- I mean clearly that is not the case. Very little of our revenue goes at list price.","I mean it's a tiny-tiny percentage. But there're other people along the value chain who obviously participate in the overall cost of the system, and so the follow through of any increase is usually much lower than the overall increase and so I think it is a misconception that many people take when they look at list price increases whether they're ours or anybody else's that those are reflective of what the brand is actually being able to achieve in the marketplace, so I think that's just the reality of the system.","Michael Severino","With respect to our Phase 2 in Alzheimer's disease, we're very excited about this program which is our anti-tau antibody and tau is a protein that is very tightly correlated to dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, and our antibody is thought to block the spreading of this pathology through the brain, and so we think it holds great promise as potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease. We just started Phase 2 right now basically and so it's going to take a bit of time before we get to meaningful data readouts. I think that the way we've designed the study, there are a number of opportunities for us to see data along the way. So, we can learn meaningful things certainly before we get to the end of a large Phase 2 study, but I think it's too early today to predict when along the course of that study that might be. Obviously, it's a program that we're going to be focused on and we're going to drive as quickly as possible.","Operator","Next question is from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line now is open.","Geoff Meacham","Sticking with the pipeline, Mike, just had a few for you. Can you give us some perspective on Elagolix? Just based on the extension study, what do you think the real world duration of therapy may be? Then just back to the tau program. I saw on the trial design that there's a screen for beta-amyloid by PET scan. Are you guys also looking at tau imaging in that study? Does that have much value, in your view? And then you mentioned tau being the marker of disease progression. I wanted to get your perspective on looking at tau as the marker versus beta-amyloid. And some would argue that time a patient sees tau accumulation, they may be too far gone, but I wanted to get your thoughts on that. Thanks.","Michael Severino","With respect to Elagolix, the ultimate duration of therapy is going to be part of the regulatory discussion and labeling discussion around that molecule, so I think it's early to predict an exact duration, but we have an extensive clinical trials program, one that included both extension studies for a longer duration of therapy and off treatment periods. So, we believe that will have the datasets to optimally support strong duration of therapy at the time of launch, and we're also pursuing post-launch Phase 3B programs to further extend both that data set and ultimately to extend duration of therapy, we believe through our approaches such as our add-back program. So, I think, it's early today to give you a concrete answer, but I think we're going to have the data to support the duration of therapy.","Turning to the tau study, the a-beta imaging in that protocol is necessary to ensure that the patients who are enrolled in the study do in fact have Alzheimer's disease, and we know that if one doesn't take that measure that there are other forms of dementia that look clinically similar to Alzheimer's disease that could be enrolled essentially in error. Those patients wouldn't be expected to benefit from the therapy aimed at Alzheimer's pathology, and so that's the rule there, it's a little bit different than the response biomarkers that are being incorporated in our trial and in many others in the Alzheimer's field.","We have a range of biomarkers in our program and a range of clinical measures that we think will allow us to interrogate this and those include imaging markers. We think we're going to have the data set to make a decision out of this trial. With respect to the correlation of tau with neuronal dysfunction, what we know about a-beta and tau is that the pattern of the pathology is different between the two. A-beta pathology peaks very early and is essentially stable at the time that disease progression occurs. It also doesn't correlate particularly well with the area of the brain that exhibits dysfunction. What we know about tau is the rise in tau pathology tracks much more closely with both neuronal dysfunction and clinical symptoms making, it very tightly linked in time to the progression of Alzheimer's disease.","It's also very tightly linked in space with respect to the progression of Alzheimer's disease. So, there are these regional variants where you have different regions in the brain that are primarily affected and if you look at a-beta in those patients, the distribution of a-beta is essentially unchanged across them, but if you look at tau, tau pathology is most permanent in the areas where there is neuronal dysfunction. So, we think that those data will indicate a strong role of time for tau and a strong role for our mechanism. Ultimately of course the Phase 2 study and downstream studies will answer those questions definitively.","Operator","Next question is from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line now is open.","Mark Schoenebaum","Thanks for taking my question. First, big thanks to Liz and the team for all the help she gave, in my absence, to my team. Really appreciate that, Liz. My question -- and I apologize if I missed this in the prepared remarks. But just for rest of world HUMIRA, would it be possible for you to just give us very clearly the quarter-on-quarter, that is sequential, volume change as well as the quarter-on-quarter, that is sequential, 3Q versus 4Q, change in price? And then this was sort of covered in the last -- in some ways in the last questions. But on the U.S. side, you have obviously, as you said earlier in response to a question, you have committed to limiting gross price increases for HUMIRA. I'm wondering how, in a general sense, we should think about trends for the gross to net that is the discounting that occurs. Would that be expected to rise, fall, stay the same? Maybe help us think through that over the next couple years in this new pricing environment. And if you are willing to, can you give us the average gross to net for 2016? Thank you. In the U.S.","William Cha","So, Mark, it's Bill Chase. I will start with sequential questions on HUMIRA. Price was pretty flat sequentially rest of world. Volume was up about 2% rest of world. So, the numbers were pretty good.","Richard Gonzalez","I think on gross demand I mean we have never communicated the growth in that before and for competitive reasons we just don\u2019t think that\u2019s something it's appropriate for us to communicate Mark. As far as trends are concern as we indicated I think it was in the third quarter call. We have negotiated all of our managed care contracts for '17. And there was not a significant change or I would say very good change in the gross to net, between those two. Some of those are both '17 and '18 and some are just '17. So, I would say there is relative stability in gross to net going forward, at least for the next year and half two years I'll say. Obviously the environment can change, but that\u2019s the view of it right now.","As you go back to the OUS, as you look it sequentially, I think we had this discussion maybe a year or so ago I remember. Outside the U.S. because there are tenders in certain places where, the quarters can jump along quite a bit. And so sequential growth quarter-to-quarter sometime is not a very good indicator of the overall growth of the brand in time. So that\u2019s the only caution I have. If you try to understand or they how is it actually performing in the back drop of the bio similar which maybe what you are trying to understand. I essentially gave to an earlier question, some of the latest biosimilar data.","The latest date that we have of the three month market share for the biosimilars, they had a very modest impact thus far. And we would expect that to continue going forward. If you look at our international HUMIRA business in 2016 and you just out the onetime impact for Venezuela for the devaluation of Venezuela. As Bill said in his comments, the brand is going from a revenue standpoint about 7%. If you actually look at volume is probably two points higher than that. So, high single digit volume growth and that\u2019s indicative of what we are seeing across most major markets where we operate, in the back drop of having Remicade and Enbrel biosimilars in many of those markets.","Operator","Next question is from Geoffrey Porges of Leerink Partners. Your line now is open.","Geoffrey Porges","Bill, could you just give us a sense of your current cash position and the US\/OUS cash? And then, in light of the suggestions about tax and sort of thing, have you flexibility to move manufacturing or any of your assets back to the U.S.? And is that something that you've contemplated as you are going through the proposals?","William Chase","Sure. So, at the end of the quarter we had about $8 billion of cash, and I think it's always safe to assume the vast majority that is overseas given that to hold cash in the U.S. under current tax paradigm is somewhat on economical to us. So, we try to keep that cash offshore. In terms of our ability to manufacture in the event that there is a tax paradigm that favors U.S. manufacturing, look, if you look at our manufacturing assets mostly our HUMIRA, which is the main point of I believe your question. We've got manufacturing facilities in the U.S., the original plant the HUMIRA was manufactured is out in Massachusetts. We also have manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico. So, obviously, we'd have to look closely to whether Puerto Rico is considered part of the U.S., which we obviously think it should be, but if that was the case then it would really be no requirement to move our supply chain around drastically.","Operator","Next question is from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley. Your line now is open.","David Risinger","So, I have a couple of questions, some of these topics were discussed. But first, Rick, I was hoping that you could just paint a picture for us for HUMIRA patent litigation to watch ahead and how we should think about it. Just what some of the key inflection points are to watch? And I'm talking about litigation here, not the IPRs. I think everybody is pretty clear on the IPR actions that are forthcoming in late spring\/early summer. Second, with respect to the tau antibody, I believe that the Phase 2 that you have discussed as having just started completes in 2020, that it's scheduled to complete in 2020. I just wanted to confirm that and I think you mentioned that there could be an interim assessment, but wanted to confirm the timing for that Phase 2 conclusion. And then finally, with respect venetoclax, could you just provide the fourth-quarter sales? Thank you.","Richard Gonzalez","So, Dave, this is Rick. Because we're in the active phase of litigation now, obviously I can't provide you a lot of color on how that will proceed, I mean obviously we're actively involved with Amgen on that litigation; you see now publicly when the trial date is scheduled for, which was consistent with the timeline that I think we discussed when we provided the longer term guidance, and so I think it's tracking on a path that ultimately is consistent with what are expectations were. And obviously as others file, we'll be going through a process with them, which will be somewhat similar to the Amgen process and we'll have to see as that plays out but nothing that I can give you color on.","On the IPRs although you said excluding the IPRs, I guess the one thing I would point out on the IPR, it's just -- it's another form of this, right. We've had two IPRs now on some of our formulation patterns, broad formulation patterns; we were successful and prevailed on those. We've two more that are coming up now on method-of-use patents in the RA area, some of our method-of-use patents in RA are being challenged. I think one thing that's important for investors to understand, the strategy that we have in place is not one that hinges on one or two patents.","I mean at the end of the day we have a portfolio patents, and its 110, and it is that portfolio patents that provides us confidence that ultimately we can protect the position which HUMIRA based on all the innovation that we've done and the investment we've made in HUMIRA that's a very broad portfolio of IP that protects it. And so regardless of which way the IPRs go this strategy is not hinged on one or two patents. So that will play out over the course of this year and the rest of the litigation will continue to play out, but I think that's important perspective for investors to have.","Michael Severino","With respect to the Phase 2 study for our tau antibody program, the completion date that would be listed on clinicaltrials.gov is the date in which the study would conclude, if it went out to the final analysis. With the Phase 2 study such as this one, there are opportunities to learn along the way as I mentioned a bit earlier. There are interim assessments. It's too early today to predict the exact timing of those assessments. But there will be opportunities along the way between today and that 2020-2022 timeframe for us to learn a lot more about the tau program and obviously as we learn more we\u2019ll communicate better.","Richard Gonzalez","On venetoclax, I think it\u2019s probably more indicative to look at the overall revenue so far in 2016. It was roughly $20 million, so relatively modest and I think there are couple of factors that you have to think through there, as Bill mentioned in his comments this is a 17p deletion is a relatively small market it's about $300 million, today IMBRUVICA between 50% and 60% of that market so other asset has a very significant share position. In addition when you start patients up because you set them up in dose, the initial month or so therapy is at a reduced cost because of the way the product is priced because it's priced on a milligram basis, and so essentially you step the patients through. So, when you're in the early phase of starting patients up then you generate less revenue because you're taking them through the start up phase. If you look at where we are right now our exit share was about a little over 20% or so, 20-22%. So the combined share between IMBRUVICA and venetoclax is significant obviously in this segment and we\u2019re starting 80-90 patients a month on average roughly.","Operator","Thank you. Your last question is from Chris Raymond of Raymond James. Your line now is open.","Chris Raymond","Just another pipeline question, maybe for Mike, on veliparib, so just curious; the literature paints maybe a less certain role for PARP inhibition in indications like lung than, say, ovarian cancer. And this year I think your first pivotal data is likely in lung. You've got squamous and non-squamous trials reading out. I wonder if you could maybe comment on that and maybe help expectations as these readouts happen. The preclinical potency data seems to suggest that other PARPs are maybe more potent than your molecule and I think I've detected a decent amount of discount assigned to veliparib by investors because of that. I wonder if you could maybe comment on that dynamic as well. Thanks.","Michael Severino","Okay, so with respect to veliparib, as you point out the role for PARP inhibition in germline carriers of BRCA mutations would be either breast cancer or ovarian is really quite clear. And of course veliparib is registered based on single-arm studies in BRCA germline carriers. We have chosen to follow a different development path, specifically because we didn\u2019t think it made a lot of sense for us to take our PARP and try to follow other into relatively a small although medically important indications like those BRCA germline carriers, that not need had already been met in our view.","So, we are testing a different hypothesis. We are testing the hypothesis that first hit doesn\u2019t have to come from a germline mutation, that in the setting of DNA damaging chemotherapy particularly platinum-based therapy. The role of DNA repair mechanisms become more important and that PARP inhibition may have an effect. Now, there is still preclinical rationale for this. The Phase 2 data were supportive of it, but it really is that Phase 3 question to answer, and so we have broad phase 2 program that will begin to readout over the course of this year. And the read out this year will be in a couple of areas neoadjuvant breast cancer as well as in two non-small cell lung cancer studies.","So, we will start to see over the course of this year whether that broader hypothesis is going to play out. We do also have a study in ovarian cancer that study is just not as advanced as the non-small cell lung cancer study. With respect to potency, I think it's very hard to determine whether preclinical potency assays such as the ones that have been used for PARPs are going to translate into the clinic. Potency can vary based on assay conditions and number of other factors, and we believe the clinical activity is ultimately what will define the role of these PARP inhibitors. And in our early phase studies, we saw good single-agent activity in line with the degree of PARP inhibition that we would have hoped to have achieved.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks Chris.

All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this conference.","I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are: Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer; and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that some statements we make today are or may be considered forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I'll briefly discuss our first quarter performance and highlights. Mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across our R&D pipeline, and Bill will discuss the quarter in more detail. As always, following our remarks, we'll take your questions.","We delivered another exceptional quarter, with results well ahead of our expectations. Our adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter were $1.87, representing growth of 46% versus the first quarter of 2017, a level of organic growth that is rarely seen in a company of our size. Our quarterly results also included global operational sales growth of more than 17%.","This industry-leading performance demonstrates the strength of our underlying business and the strong foundation we have built. Since our inception, we have strived to create a business that has multiple strong growth drivers. This quarter clearly demonstrates that level of diversity, with HUMIRA, IMBRUVICA, and MAVYRET all delivering significant contributions to our growth.","Based on our strong performance year to date as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year, as indicated in our news release this morning, we are increasing our full-year EPS guidance for 2018, which I'll discuss in more detail here in a few moments.","HUMIRA delivered global operational sales growth of 10.7% in the quarter. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales grew 11.4%, driven by continued strong prescription volume growth across all three categories. Internationally, operational sales growth was 9.3%. HUMIRA continues to hold the number one market share position across all three categories, and we're pleased with the strong market trends that we're seeing across geographies as well as therapeutic segments.","During the quarter, we also announced our second global settlement agreement, resolving all IP-related litigation with Samsung over their biosimilar to HUMIRA. Since our first settlement with Amgen back in 2017, the strength of our IP portfolio has been further validated by four successful IPR decisions. We remain confident that we will not see direct biosimilar competition in the U.S. until at least 2022.","Moving now to IMBRUVICA, IMBRUVICA delivered strong momentum and growth, with global sales increasing more than 38% over the prior year. IMBRUVICA has continued to expand its position as the clear market share leader across all lines of therapy in CLL, driven by its strong durable response and superior survival benefit over standard of care.","Global HCV sales were $919 million in the first quarter, with global MAVYRET sales of nearly $850 million. MAVYRET has continued its strong launch trajectory in both the U.S. and international markets. MAVYRET has now achieved a market share in the U.S. of 45%, and we currently have access to more than three-quarters of the covered lives, with the majority of that access at parity. MAVYRET has established a strong position in other major countries as well, such as Japan, Germany, Spain, and Italy.","Clearly, the launch of MAVYRET has exceeded our initial expectations. We're pleased with the strong clinical profile and our commercial execution, which has driven our ability to gain U.S. formulary access and ramp significantly faster than what we had anticipated. We now project full-year HCV sales of approximately $3.5 billion.","We also continue to see strong performance from several other products, including Lupron, Creon, and Duopa, which continue to be very stable, profitable products within our base business.","We're highly encouraged by our commercial performance and financial results in the quarter. We're off to another excellent start in 2018, reinforcing our confidence in the strong fundamentals of our business.","As we discussed on our earnings call back in January, we view the passage of U.S. tax reform as an important business driver for companies like ours. It has enabled more efficient access to foreign cash and the ability to deploy it effectively within the U.S. We previously highlighted a number of our plans to capitalize on this flexibility, including investing roughly $2.5 billion in capital projects in the U.S. over the next five years, as well as our commitment to a one-time charitable contribution of approximately $350 million to select not-for-profit organizations.","Since that time, we've continued to contemplate the most effective ways to deploy our investment opportunities from tax reform to maximize the benefit and to support our business over the long term. Now with the benefit of tax reform, we expect to invest more aggressively in R&D, exploring opportunities to augment our early-stage pipeline and add additional R&D capabilities. In support of this, we plan to continue to expand our oncology presence in Northern California, with a focus on further driving R&D innovation.","We also plan to invest more heavily in support of numerous products we expect to launch over the next 18 months, ensuring that these new therapies are well-positioned to achieve their maximum commercial potential. All of these actions demonstrate that tax reform is having the intended impact, creating new jobs and helping to stimulate U.S. investment.","Based on our strong cash flow generation and our confidence in our long-term outlook, in February we announced a significant increase in our return of capital to shareholders through a 35% increase in our quarterly cash dividend and a new $10 billion stock repurchase program. This morning, we announced that we are launching a Dutch auction tender offer to commence as early as May 1 and to purchase up to $7.5 billion of our stock.","Despite AbbVie's exceptional shareholder return, we continue to believe our stock is fundamentally undervalued, especially following the Rova-T news, which I'll discuss in more detail in a moment. This tender offer further demonstrates our ongoing commitment to deliver exceptional shareholder return and our continued confidence in our company's long-term prospects.","As you know, on the first quarter call, we provided 2018 EPS guidance of $7.33 to $7.43, which reflected growth of 32% at the midpoint. There have been a number of significant developments since we issued that guidance back in January, primarily our stronger than expected operating performance in the first quarter and our expectations for continued robust underlying business performance as well as the acceleration of our planned share buybacks through the tender offer.","As a result, we are raising our full-year EPS guidance range by $0.33 to $7.66 to $7.76. The midpoint of this revised guidance is $7.71, and that reflects industry-leading EPS growth of 38% over 2017. The majority of the increase in this revised guidance is being driven by stronger underlying business performance. Bill will walk you through an update on our 2018 guidance, including our expectations for top line performance, in just a few moments.","I'm going to close my remarks this morning with some comments about R&D. As we recently disclosed, after consulting with the FDA, we made the decision to not seek accelerated approval on Rova-T in third-line small-cell lung cancer. And while we were disappointed with this outcome, we were encouraged by the single-agent activity that Rova-T demonstrated in these very advanced patients, and TRINITY represents the second trial where we've shown clear single-agent responses. We look forward to the data from the ongoing Phase 3 trials in first and second-line small-cell lung cancer, both of which have active comparator arms. We remain encouraged in earlier lines of therapy. And in combination with other agents, we have the potential to see stronger results and more durability of response.","But despite the setback with Rova-T, we continue to believe that we have one of the most compelling pipelines in the industry, based not only on the quality and growth potential of the assets, but also on the diversity of the opportunities. We have an attractive collection of innovative late-stage assets with differentiated clinical profiles that deliver meaningful patient benefits.","Given that we have largely completed registrational programs for a number of our assets, we have a tremendous level of confidence in their probability of regulatory and commercial success. For example, we recently reported the fourth of five pivotal trials on upadacitinib in RA. Each study has reinforced our view that upadacitinib is truly a best-in-class asset.","For risankizumab, after reporting best-in-category results across four pivotal studies in psoriasis, we've now submitted our U.S. regulatory application, and our EMA application will be submitted within the next few days. We are confident that both of these next-generation immunology assets will achieve strong competitive positions within their respective markets.","With Venclexta, we are nearing the launch of a major label expansion in relapsed refractory CLL, which represents a meaningful market for AbbVie. We're already hearing positive feedback from KOLs who view Venclexta as a potential game-changing new therapy for patients with CLL.","And we're in the final stages of regulatory review for elagolix in endometriosis. When approved, elagolix will be an important new treatment option for patients in this area of high unmet need and a significant market opportunity for our company.","Beyond their initial indications, each of these assets have sizable opportunities in follow-on indications, where we're already in late-stage development. These include: Venclexta in AML and multiple myeloma; elagolix in uterine fibroids; and several important new indications for upadacitinib and risankizumab, such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and atopic dermatitis, among others.","We're excited to see the evolution of our pipeline from promising late-stage development compounds to on-market products. We feel highly confident about our pipeline and its ability to drive top-tier long-term growth. Our pipeline represents a significant yet underappreciated growth driver for AbbVie.","AbbVie is a company that has consistently demonstrated we live up to our commitments and we deliver top-tier performance. We're a company that has exceptionally strong operating performance, as is clearly demonstrated by our financial results, an impressive late-stage pipeline, an efficient tax structure, and a compelling philosophy on return of capital to our shareholders, as demonstrated by our dividend growth and our share repurchase program.","So in summary, we're extremely pleased with our outperformance in the quarter and with the strong momentum of our business, leading to the increase in our expectations for 2018. We have a high degree of confidence in our ability to continue to successfully execute on our long-term strategy and deliver outstanding shareholder value.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on R&D. Mike?","Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.","Thank you, Rick.","Today I'll highlight recent pipeline updates and discuss key milestones we anticipate for the remainder of 2018. I'll start with our immunology programs, where we are nearing completion of the registrational programs for our two late-stage assets, upadacitinib and risankizumab, in their initial indications of RA and psoriasis respectively. Based on the data we've generated to date, each of these assets has the potential to significantly advance standard of care in a number of immune-mediated conditions.","Earlier this month we reported top line results from the SELECT-COMPARE study, which evaluated upadacitinib against both placebo and HUMIRA in patients who did not adequately respond to methotrexate. This was the fourth study in the SELECT clinical program, and the results showed a significant impact on both signs and symptoms and radiographic progression compared to placebo as well as improvements in important measures, such as ACR response and low disease activity compared to HUMIRA. Given its strong profile, upadacitinib has the potential to be a best-in-class therapy in RA and could offer meaningful advantages over products on the market today or in development.","We are also obviously aware of the recent FDA Advisory Committee meeting on baricitinib. In our view, the primary safety considerations for bari relating to DVT and PE are the presence of an imbalance of thrombotic events in the controlled portions of their trials, challenges to finding the benefit\/risk profile of the lower dose, and potentially concern over sustained increases in platelets in comparison to baseline. When we look at the upadacitinib program, we remain confident in our safety profile, both overall and with respect to DVT and PE rates.","Today we have unblinded results from four of the five pivotal studies that will support our global registration. When we look across the controlled periods of these four studies, we have reported five patients with events of DVT or PE in the upadacitinib groups, as compared to four patients with these events in the comparator groups. Thus, we see very similar numbers of events despite the fact that more patients received upadacitinib than comparator in these studies. Therefore, we do not see an imbalance in these data.","Second, we have designed and conducted a program that will characterize the benefit\/risk profile of both doses of upadacitinib independently. Notably, our lower dose was included in all pivotal studies and important parts of our program, such as our head-to-head data against HUMIRA, and our structural data were performed at the lower dose.","Third, with respect to platelets, the pattern we observed with upadacitinib in our Phase 3 studies is a modest decrease in platelets by week four, which returns towards baseline over time. We expect to see data from the final study in our registrational program, the SELECT-EARLY trial, in the coming months, with our regulatory submission following in the second half of the year.","Moving now to our other late-stage immunology asset, risankizumab, we've completed the registrational program for the psoriasis indication, and just yesterday announced that we have submitted our BLA in the U.S. The European submission is anticipated very shortly. In all four Phase 3 studies in the pivotal program risankizumab consistently showed very high and durable rates of skin clearance. Based on these results, we believe risankizumab has the potential to significantly improve upon current treatment options for both bio-naive and TNF-inadequate responder populations with moderate to severe psoriasis while offering the convenience of quarterly dosing.","We continue to make good progress with the development programs for both upadacitinib and risankizumab in several other immune-mediated conditions, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriatic arthritis, and atopic dermatitis. Phase 3 studies are underway for several of these indications, and we plan to start registrational programs for the remaining indications over the course of the next year. We look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature.","Moving now to oncology, where we continue to advance our programs for IMBRUVICA and Venclexta, we've seen very strong activity across a broad range of hematologic malignancies with these two therapies, demonstrating their potential to transform treatment by driving better long-term disease control and better outcome for patients.","With IMBRUVICA, we continue to build the body of evidence in CLL as well as in other blood cancers. We have several studies ongoing to evaluate IMBRUVICA alone and as a combination therapy in different patient segments, including young and fit patients and the watch-and-wait population. These studies will add to the breadth of data supporting IMBRUVICA, providing physicians more evidence of the compelling clinical benefits in the front-line setting. We expect to begin seeing data from these Phase 3 trials next year.","Moving now to Venclexta, which is currently under Priority Review with the FDA for use in relapsed refractory CLL in combination with Rituxan, we continue to expect a midyear approval for this broader relapsed refractory CLL population, moving us further towards our goal of establishing Venclexta as a foundational chemotherapy-free option in the CLL market.","Beyond our core strategy in CLL, we are making great progress with our development programs to expand Venclexta across other hematologic malignancies such as AML and multiple myeloma. We remain on track to submit our U.S. regulatory application for Venclexta in AML later this summer. And we look forward to bringing this new treatment option to the substantial group of previously untreated AML patients who can't receive high-dose induction chemotherapy. This submission is based on the substantial activity we've seen with Venclexta in our mid-stage studies and represents a significant acceleration of our AML program.","The Phase 3 studies in AML are ongoing, with data readouts expected next year. The Phase 3 program in multiple myeloma is also progressing well, with key data becoming available in the first half of 2019.","I'll now turn to our solid tumor programs, where, despite some disappointing news in the quarter that we won't be seeking accelerated approval for Rova-T in third-line or greater small-cell lung cancer, we're making continued progress with Rova-T in earlier lines of therapy as well as with our early-stage solid tumor programs.","In March, we announced top line results from the TRINITY study in third-line small-cell lung cancer. While Rova-T demonstrated single-agent responses in these advanced patients, after consulting with the FDA, we made the decision not to seek accelerated approval based on this single-arm study.","Although the results from the TRINITY study were not what we had hoped for, we believe that in earlier lines of therapy and in combination with other agents, Rova-T has the potential to provide important clinical benefit. And we look forward to data from the ongoing and MERU and TAHOE trials in first and second-line small-cell lung cancer. The MERU and TAHOE studies are expected to read out in the 2020 timeframe and should provide definitive evidence of Rova-T's potential as an important treatment option for small-cell lung cancer patients.","And finally, in the area of women's health, our regulatory application for elagolix in endometriosis is currently under review. We recently announced that the FDA has extended the review time by three months after requesting additional information regarding the results of liver function testing from the clinical program. We have submitted our response to the agency. And, based on our review of the data, we remain confident in our application, and we look forward to approval in the third quarter.","In addition to the endometriosis program, we continue to make good progress with our pivotal program evaluating elagolix in combination with low-dose hormone add-back therapy in women with uterine fibroids. In the first quarter, we announced positive top line results from both Phase 3 uterine fibroid studies, where elagolix in combination with low-dose add-back therapy met the primary and all ranked secondary endpoints in both studies. Data from both pivotal studies as well as data from the six-month extensions will support our regulatory submission for elagolix in this indication in 2019.","So in summary, we have continued to make significant progress with our pipeline, and we look forward to many more important data readouts, regulatory submissions, and approvals throughout the remainder of the year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our first quarter performance.","William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Mike.","As Rick said, we delivered another quarter of outstanding performance with strong top and bottom line growth. Total net revenues for the first quarter were $7.9 billion, up 17.6% operationally, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.87, up 46.1% compared to the first quarter of 2017 and exceeding our guidance for the quarter.","HUMIRA global sales were $4.7 billion, up 10.7% operationally. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased 11.4% compared to the prior year, with prescription volume growth of 9% and price in the mid-single digits. Growth in the quarter was impacted by retail inventory destocking at a large specialty pharmacy. Excluding the impact of this destocking, HUMIRA sales growth in the U.S. would have been over 13%. Wholesaler inventory levels were below half a month in all quarters.","International HUMIRA sales were $1.7 billion in the quarter, up 9.3% on an operational basis or 20% including the impact of foreign exchange. The quarter's performance benefited to a degree from shipment timing. Excluding this impact, operating performance was over 7%. Despite increasing competition, HUMIRA has maintained its strong position as the leading front-line therapy across all approved indications, demonstrating its unique product profile and strong physician preference.","Global IMBRUVICA net revenues in the first quarter were $762 million, up 38.5% year over year, with continued strong uptake in CLL as well as other approved indications.","Global HCV sales in the first quarter were $919 million, with MAVYRET sales of approximately $850 million. As Rick mentioned, we've been extremely pleased with the launch of MAVYRET in the U.S. and international markets. In the U.S., penetration of the commercial markets has exceeded our initial expectations, with formulary access across roughly 75% of covered lives and more rapid share gains than we originally anticipated.","In the first quarter, we saw an increase in global patient volume, driven primarily by the treatment of warehoused DAA failure patients in Japan and a slightly higher level of treated patients in the U.S. relative to volume in the back half of 2017.","Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 16.5% operationally, and we also saw strong growth with Creon and Lupron.","Turning now to the P&L profile for the first quarter, adjusted gross margin was 80.2% of sales compared to 79.9% in the prior year. This was inclusive of the year-over-year negative impact of partnership accounting and an additional negative impact of exchange due to the strengthening of hedged currencies. Adjusted R&D was 15% of sales in the quarter, supporting our ongoing pipeline programs in oncology, immunology, and other areas. Adjusted SG&A was 21% of sales in the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting continued investment in our unmarketed products as well as investment in advance of several upcoming product launches.","The adjusted operating margin was 44.1% of sales in the first quarter, an improvement of 200 basis points versus the prior year.","Net interest expense was $251 million in the first quarter. The adjusted tax rate was 7.6% in the quarter, with the rate benefiting from the timing of compensation programs.","First quarter adjusted EPS excluding specified items was $1.87, up 46.1% year over year.","As mentioned earlier this morning, based on our strong outperformance year to date as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are raising our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $7.66 and $7.76. At the midpoint, this new guidance range is $0.33 higher than our prior guidance, with more than half of the increase from stronger operating performance. Our revised midpoint represents annual growth of 38% versus 2017. This revised guidance contemplates revenue approaching $32.6 billion and reflects a favorable foreign currency benefit of approximately 2%.","Included in this guidance are the following assumptions for our key products. We expect U.S. sales of HUMIRA of approximately $13.7 billion. We continue to see robust prescription growth and maintain a strong leadership position across all segments. This guidance reflects the retail specialty pharmacy destocking that we are seeing in the market as well as a moderately more conservative stance on co-pay costs associated with cost accumulator programs in certain high-deductible commercial plans. While these programs have not materially impacted the first quarter performance, we continue to monitor them closely in order to minimize any impact on patient access.","At current exchange rates, we expect international HUMIRA sales to approach $6.4 billion this year. This guidance assumes operational growth roughly in line with our prior expectations and is inclusive of the impact of direct biosimilar entrants in the fourth quarter of 2018.","For IMBRUVICA, we continue to expect global revenues to AbbVie of greater than $3.3 billion, with U.S. sales just above $2.7 billion. And we are now forecasting global HCV sales in 2018 to be approximately $3.5 billion.","Turning now to the P&L for 2018, as Rick noted during his remarks, with the passage of tax reform, we will be making further investments to support long-term growth. In 2018, we are forecasting SG&A approaching 20.5% of sales, reflecting investments to maximize the potential of assets launching in 2018 and 2019. We currently expect full-year R&D expense of just above 16% of our revised sales projection.","We are forecasting operating margin above 43.5% of sales, more than 100 basis points above 2017, inclusive of the incremental investments in support of our upcoming product launches and an expected negative impact from currency.","We now expect net interest expense of approximately $1.1 billion, inclusive of the financing impact of the announced share repurchase activities. And we are forecasting an adjusted tax rate approaching 9%.","As we look ahead to the second quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $1.94 and $1.96. Our second quarter adjusted EPS guidance excludes roughly $0.34 of non-cash amortization, impact from tax reform, and other specified items.","We are forecasting operational revenue growth in the second quarter of approximately 15%. Holding exchange rates constant at current levels, we would expect foreign exchange to have a favorable impact to sales growth of approximately 3% in the second quarter.","For U.S. HUMIRA, we expect sales growth in the second quarter approaching 10%. Internationally, we expect HUMIRA sales approaching $1.6 billion, assuming current exchange rates.","For IMBRUVICA, we expect U.S. sales approaching $700 million. And for HCV, we expect global sales of approximately $950 million, with approximately 40% of those sales coming from U.S. sales.","With respect to the non-GAAP tax rate, the second quarter should be modeled in line with our annual guidance approaching 9%.","In summary, we are very pleased with AbbVie's performance in the quarter, with results well ahead of our expectations. We have driven industry-leading revenue and EPS growth and are well positioned to continue to advance our strategic priorities.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thank, Bill. We'll now open the call for questions. Operator, we'll take the first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question today is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Rick, I just have a couple questions. The first is I think that certainly some of us were surprised by the magnitude of the market share loss following the disappointing news around TRINITY. I think you lost about $30 billion in market cap. And given the small amount of revenues that we had in our models, that seemed like an overreaction. But maybe not, the market is smarter than we are.","But I'm just wondering. As you were weighing the pros and cons of a Dutch auction or utilizing that authorized $10 billion buyback versus maybe making the decision to redeploy that cash into bolt-on deals, can you just talk about how you arrived at your decision to buy back stock instead of going out and buying assets? I think some investors saw the news as yes, this is bad news, but I think it also opened up questions that investors have had for so many years again about the durability of HUMIRA, the value of the pipeline, et cetera, et cetera. So if you could, talk about that.","And then, Mike, just to follow up, that was a really good explanation about upadacitinib and the trials that you've reported to date. But I'm just curious why you haven't disclosed the DVT\/PE rates. You gave us the absolute number, but the actual rates. And any clarity on Grade 2\/3\/4 hemoglobin decrease versus placebo, given we saw a dose response and placebo imbalance in your Phase 2b study. Thanks very much.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Hi, Jami. This is Rick. I'll take the first question and Mike can cover the second question. Certainly, I think we view the reaction to the TRINITY data as a gross overreaction. I'll come back to that here in a moment. But ultimately, we made the decision to go forward with the Dutch auction essentially based on that gross overreaction. We fundamentally believe that the market reaction to the Rova-T data was overdone by a magnitude of 4x or 5x, and therefore, the stock is very undervalued. And when we see situations like that, we're going to take advantage of that. We think that's the appropriate thing to do.","We're in the fortunate position that we generate a tremendous amount of cash flow in this business. And despite doing this, we still have all the flexibility that we need to be able to do whatever acquisitions or licensing arrangements that we'd like to do to be able to build the business. And we continue to work on various options, so we don't view this as in any way limiting our flexibility to be able to move forward and do the things that we need to be able to do. As I said, we have the flexibility to be able to do both, and we think this is an appropriate use of some of our cash flow because we think the reaction was dramatically overdone.","And to that point, what I would say is if you look at our pipeline and you look at the level of performance that this company has delivered over the last several years, we've delivered top-tier performance. We've built a pipeline that is clearly capable of continuing to drive top-tier performance. Rova-T was the smallest of those assets in our late-stage pipeline. It had an immaterial impact on our overall growth rate in third-line. It was the only non-derisked asset that we had, meaning all the other assets that we have in our late-stage pipeline, we have a significant amount of Phase 3 data that supports the profile of those assets and the confidence that we have around regulatory approval of those assets.","And so look, there are always bears on every stock out there. There's always people who have an interest in shorting. They've been seeing ghosts now for a number of years. And at the end of the day, I don't see the same ghosts that they see. Now, it doesn't mean that it wasn't painful to see the reaction, but our job is to continue to drive the business and to drive the level of performance, and you see that in the quarter that we're operating in. And I can tell you, we have confidence that you're going to see it going forward. And over time, markets tend to figure things out, and I think in our case, that will be the case as well. So we certainly feel good about what our prospects look like going forward.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay, this is Mike. I'll take the question about upadacitinib and DVT and PE rates. So I think there are a number of things one has to consider when one evaluates the safety of any Phase 3 program. And comparison to background rates is one of the things that we look at, but it's certainly not the only thing and it's also not the most important thing.","We talked about our rates being within expectations of background, and they have been throughout the course of this program. And that is one of the early indicators that we look at as our data accrue. But we now have four out of our five studies, which is a fairly substantial amount of our placebo-controlled and active comparator controlled program in the public domain, at least at the top line level. And that's why in my explanation today, I focus on what we've seen there, because what you see within your own program is of course going to be the most important.","So you ask why not disclose the DVT and PE rate, we will when we have our full program. The rate changes. It has stayed within that background rate, but there's not a final number until we're done with our program. And when we unblind all of our studies, we'll talk to folks about the DVT and PE rate. But we'll also talk about what we've seen within the randomized part of our trial and the overall safety picture, which, as I indicated, we continue to have confidence in.","With respect to your question on hemoglobin, AEs of anemia have been uncommon across the program. They've been seen in all groups, including placebo, and we haven't seen a signal for an increase.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Jami. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Schimmer from Evercore.","Joshua Schimmer - Evercore, Inc.","Great, thank you. I have three very concise questions. First, how do you see the long-term sustainability of the HCV franchise performance in terms of price and volume relative to current levels? Two, do you see any scenario in which you could file for Rova-T approval this year in the U.S. or ex-U.S.? And number three, maybe you can outline the path to market and positioning for Venclexta in myeloma. Thank you.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","So, Josh, this is Rick. I'll take the first question. I think Mike probably will cover two and three. So long-term sustainability of HCV, HCV is obviously a big and attractive market. MAVYRET has done extremely well. It has a profile that fits the marketplace well. I think our execution and our launch strategy has worked well, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S.","Although the patient volumes do vary a bit and they're not totally predictable, so you do see some fluctuation in treatment volumes around the world and within the U.S. as well, that makes it a little bit more difficult to be able to forecast and predict with a high degree of precision. But this is a market that is going to be around for a long, long time and be a very big market. And I think now, essentially you have us and one competitor who have the lion's share of this marketplace. We're obviously doing extremely well. We have leadership position in a number of markets. And where we don't have the leadership position, we're awfully close to the market leader and continuing to move in that direction.","And so we view this as an attractive market, and we certainly view that we have an asset that will allow us to be able to stay highly competitive and in a leadership position going forward. And so we view it as an important market for us, and we think we have the right tools to be effective over the long term.","Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay, this is Mike. With respect to your second question, for Rova-T in the U.S., we view the primary path to approval as the randomized studies, MERU and TAHOE, and that's based on discussions with the FDA. So unless things change substantially there, and we don't expect that they will, we'll continue to view that as the primary path to approval. In Europe, we've not communicated a decision because we're still in discussions with the regulators. And when we reach a conclusion there, we'll obviously communicate it.","With Venclexta in multiple myeloma, we have an ongoing study in a broader multiple myeloma patient, but we also have efforts that are targeted at a particular subset of multiple myeloma, t(11;14). This is a subset that tends to be driven by BCL-2. They have a phenotype that's a good fit for a BCL-2 inhibitor like Venclexta, and we've seen very encouraging initial results. So that's an area that we'll continue to pursue as well.","t(11;14) is a subset of multiple myeloma, but it's a fairly substantial subset, 15% to 20% of patients, with of course the overall myeloma population being quite large, unfortunately, so there are a significant number of patients with that translocation. So we see both as potential paths that are very promising for Venclexta in myeloma.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Josh. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America.","Jason M. Gerberry - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Quickly on U.S. HUMIRA, based on the updated guide, it looks like you're not getting much in terms of net price benefit anymore, and I'm just curious. The comments about the co-pay accumulators and whatnot, is that just being conservative into something that's an unknown and difficult for you to quantify at the moment, or as you look forward in this market, do you see the new norm now as low single-digit net price benefits? And if you can comment in terms of where you guys are at with 2019 contracts, that would be helpful. Thanks.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","This is Rick. Maybe I'll cover most of that and then have Bill fill in any details. If you look at overall net price benefit that we're seeing in HUMIRA, it's consistent with what we've communicated at the beginning of the year. And that is that we're seeing prescription volume growth of about 9% in the U.S., and we're seeing mid-single-digit price fall-through. And that's consistent with what we had planned for, with one price increase at the level that we have been communicating.","As far as accumulator programs and our comments around that, obviously these are a new entity that has moved into the marketplace. It's not a large percentage of the overall patient volume. It represents about 4% or so of the HUMIRA patient volume, so it's not a very large portion of the patients.","Obviously, we think these programs are bad policy, particularly for patients that are on specialty medicines, chronic specialty medicines. And we have not seen any impact from them in the first quarter yet, although I'm not sure we would see a big impact in the first quarter based on how they operate. What we are assuming going forward is that, because of the higher deductibles that these patients will have that potentially we will see an increase in their use of the co-pay programs that we and all of our competitors have as well, that the amount of funds that they need to be able to get to their deductible will be higher than what we're running now on average across the board. And so what we have built in is some additional amounts for that patient population.","And probably the easiest way to think about it is this. So if they have a higher average deductible than what the average was in the prior years, most of these patients, because they do have chronic conditions, have many other medical expense as well. So if they would normally have gotten to their deductible in month two at the lower deductibles, now they may not get to their deductible until month four. And obviously, we don't want to lose those patients over a month or two. So within our co-pay programs today, they have the flexibility to go higher. They just don't go higher because of where the deductibles are. And so essentially what we're describing is that phenomenon that we have built in more expense associated with that.","We're not sure whether we'll see it. We think it's the appropriate thing to do, and we obviously have enough performance in the business that we can do it at this point and watch how it goes and still deliver exceptional performance and actually raise our guidance at the same time. So we're in a fortunate position from that perspective. We're obviously monitoring it carefully and we're going to have to see how it sorts out. It may not be at the impact that we've described here, but I think it's the appropriate way to model the going-forward business until we have more experience with these programs.","On 2019, I think we're still early in that process, so I don't know that we have a lot of comments that we could give you at this point on that contract status. I would tell you in the discussions that we've had, we would not expect major differences in gross-to-net or major differences in the level of coverage that we have in lives. So at a very high level, I think that's the way you ought to be thinking about it. But more specificity than that would come later in the year. Bill?","William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.","And then, Jason, the only other thing I'll add regarding our revised HUMIRA guidance is we are assuming that the destock that we saw in first quarter is a permanent destock. We don't have that coming back. And likewise, when we look at the retail channel in particular, we think we could see a little bit more destocking in the second quarter. So that's been baked into the number as well.","Jason M. Gerberry - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, thank you.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Jason. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. First, congrats on the great results. The trends in psoriasis for the IL-17s have become a concern. How are HUMIRA trends in psoriasis? And to what do attribute the weakness in the IL-17s? So that's the first question.","The second question is on Rova-T. You mentioned that you're encouraged by the single-agent activity you've seen in TRINITY, but you also mentioned durability as perhaps less than hoped. I'm wondering if you can elaborate.","And then lastly, the SELECT-SUNRISE trial may suggest that you may advance upadacitinib at a lower 7.5-milligram dose in RA. Is that the correct interpretation? Thank you.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Mike, why don't you cover two and three and then I'll come back and cover one?","Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay, I'll start with SELECT-SUNRISE. So the SELECT-SUNRISE study was a study done in Japan. And it's not uncommon for the PMDA, the Japanese regulator, to request additional dose-ranging on studies that are done in Japan for a number of reasons. And so I think you should view the inclusion of the 7.5-milligram dose in that light. The 7.5-milligram dose had lower levels of response, particularly when you look at measures like ACR50 and other more stringent measures, not only in SUNRISE, but also in our global Phase 2b study. So we feel very good about our dose selection, and we're not intending to pursue 7.5-milligram global.","With respect to Rova-T, we have seen single-agent activity now in two studies. We think that's very important. The level of activity we have seen is very different than what one would expect with conventional chemotherapy in that setting. That rate, if it's not zero, is in the low single digits. We've seen results that show by independent radiographic review a 16% response rate in the data that we've put out previously. And that gives us confidence that we're seeing good activity, and that ought to translate into clinical benefit in those other studies that I described.","The comment regarding durability has to do just with the standard for registration from a single-arm study in a setting like this. And that standard is very high, and the patients that we studied in TRINITY were very advanced. Many were past a point of no return, if you will. There was a lot of very early mortality. So in that setting, it's hard to demonstrate the sort of durability that we had hoped for, and that's what that comment reflects. But we feel good about the activity overall. And we think as we move forward in lines of therapy and also as we combine with other active mechanisms, there is the potential for real and important clinical benefit.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","As far as the psoriasis trends in the IL-17s, I think the trends you're seeing on the IL-17s is similar to what we've talked about on previous calls, and that is that they tend to be relegated to second-line and beyond. So typically, after the patient fails the first-line therapy, which in most cases is HUMIRA, then they'll go on to use an agent like the IL-17s. So I haven't seen a whole lot of change in the overall market dynamics around that.","Maybe another way to think about it is to more broadly look at HUMIRA, and not just the psoriasis market but overall the market. And if you look at HUMIRA, obviously it continues to perform extremely well. It performs well because it's in big markets that are growing, and obviously the asset has the profile and our execution is such that we get the vast majority of the front-line patients moving into HUMIRA and we're able to sustain those patients over time.","If you look at the overall market growth rate, it's running about 10% or 11%. That varies from mid-single digits, 6%, 7% in rheumatology to high teens in derm and GI. So those are big markets that continue to grow nicely. If you look at our Rx growth, on average, it was about 9% this quarter. Again, that varies at about a little over 6% in rheum, double-digit, 10%, 11%, 12% in derm, and GI is more like 12% or 13% overall script growth rates.","The important thing in this market is to capture the front-line patients and maintain those patients over time. And so if you look at every one of the sub-categories for HUMIRA, essentially RA, SPA, PSA, AS, psoriasis, Crohn's, and UC, those are the major categories that we measure and you look at first-line capture rate, HUMIRA is number one in every single one of those. It varies anywhere from around 30% on the low end to as high as 56% of new patients capture on the high end across those categories.","And so the brand continues to perform extremely well and the markets continue to perform extremely well. But there's still room for a lot of agents in this market because not all patients respond to any one agent, so you need multiple therapies to be able to put those patients in the appropriate level of control. And so the IL-17s and the IL-23s and many other mechanisms will have a role to play in the treatment paradigm for these patients going forward.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Steve. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for the questions. My first question was just on HUMIRA ex-U.S. and specifically Europe. Can you just talk through a little bit of your expectations on qualitatively quarterly progression of that franchise from here as we think about the biosimilar entry later this year? And maybe as part of that, can you just talk a little bit about what you're doing ahead of biosimilar entry to defend the franchise, and should that \u2013 you kind of impact results at all as we think about the coming quarters?","My second question was a Rova-T question and just on this dynamic around seeing additional data, not just single-agent but combination. When can we think about getting more robust combination data with Rova-T specifically with some of the PD-1s? Is that something we could see this year, or is that something that's more of a 2019 or 2020 event? Thank you very much.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Chris, this is Rick. I'll cover the HUMIRA question and Mike will cover the Rova-T question.","So as we indicated in the last call, we have started our preparation activities for biosimilars outside the U.S. in those countries that are going to face biosimilar activity in the fourth quarter of this year. So we have implemented \u2013 started the process of implementing our defense strategy. I would say that is going as we would have expected. It's going well thus far, and we're preparing for what will ultimately be the impact that we see in the fourth quarter. We obviously saw robust growth in the first quarter. Bill may be able to talk to that. There was some timing that was in \u2013 timing of some shipments within that quarter. Bill, do you want to touch on that?","William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.","Yeah, it was about 2 points of the overall. So if you back that out, the operational growth in the first quarter was 7%, which was still strong. Q2 we would expect a lower growth rate given the reversal of that timing. I think in the 3% to 4% range would be a good number to bank on at this point.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","But I'd say if you look at last year and you look at where we are now, you would expect that the business will grow there up until the fourth quarter in the mid-single digit range, which is what we would expect. And then you will start to see the impact of biosimilars. A little harder to tell at this point exactly how that's going to go. We've modeled it and I think we have a pretty good idea of how that will progress and I think it will fall within the expectations that we have put forth. But we're going to need to see as it actually plays out and we watch what the biosimilars' launch strategies really look like, but I think we're well prepared to be able to deal with that. Rova-T?","Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay. So with respect to combo data with Rova-T and I-O therapies, first I'll say that there's good pre-clinical rationale to believe that the combination of those two agents will be very effective. We currently have an early to mid-stage trial looking at the combination of Rova-T with I-O agents in collaboration with BMS. That's looking at both nivo [nivolumab] and nivo-ipi [ipilimumab] combos. That is an early to mid-stage trial, as I said, so there's not a single period for data readout. Data can be presented as individual arms of the study mature. But I would say that over the course of this year and into the next, we ought to have data that we can talk about there. So it's in that timeframe that we'll be able to see clinical data to support this hypothesis.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Chris. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys, thanks for the question. I have a couple of pipeline ones. Mike, when you look at both upadacitinib and risankizumab, the profiles look differentiated. Is there anything that you can read into the durability of effect? I guess where I'm going with this is, when you look at the use of I&I [Inflammation & Immunology] agents, you see sequential therapies, and maybe every two to three years patients switch. Is there a potential for either one of these assets to have a much longer duration of therapy, which obviously would impact the model?","And then just on the hep C front, I just wanted to get a sense from you guys maybe over the course of this year where you see the pace of OUS new countries and new launches just with respect to reimbursement decisions and the like. Thank you.","Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay, so I'll start with the question on upadacitinib and risankizumab. So when we look at the efficacy profiles, we also see significant differentiation. We see that in a number of important areas. With upadacitinib, we see very high levels of response, high levels of response on the more stringent endpoints, high levels of response in biologic-inadequate responders, and that's in an RA population. Of course, we have other indications that we are pursuing as well, such as inflammatory bowel diseases and atopic dermatitis.","And the picture in each of these is slightly different in terms of what the therapeutic landscape looks like. What I would say is both the level of that response and the duration of that response that we've seen in the trials to date we view as very, very encouraging. And so we think that that asset will have a very strong efficacy profile, and we do think that durability will be part of that.","When we look at risankizumab, we see a picture that's very similar. We're driving very high levels of response, particularly on the stringent endpoints. And there I would point particularly to the 52-week data in psoriasis, and those data are very strong and show very high levels of response at even the PASI 90 and PASI 100 level at those endpoints. So we also think that durability will be an important point for the risa story. And so we think that between those two assets across the indications that I mentioned, we're going to be able to cover a large part of the medical need.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","In the case of HCV, I think if you look at our business, we have been rolling out in all the major countries around the world. The most recent one that we rolled out was France, and prior to that was Japan. Japan, obviously we had tremendous success in Japan, achieved market leadership in a very short period of time and sustained a very high level of market share, so the adoption of the product in Japan was extremely good. We're ramping in France now to some extent. What is left is typically smaller countries now. We'll be rolling those out over the course of the next several months.","As far as reimbursement decisions, it varies pretty dramatically. When the first generation of HCV products came out, many countries did two things. One, they typically funded their later-stage later F-score patients, and they funded their healthcare budgets on a year-by-year basis, which isn't typical of how they would do a program like this. But because of that, they had to come back each year and make a determination as to how much funding they would put in. We still see that happening in certain countries around the world.","So it is a difficult question I guess for me to answer for you with any level of specificity. But generally speaking, I'd say if you look across the board, the overall reimbursed population is relatively consistent. The mix is obviously different, but it does vary from country to country.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks a lot.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Geoff. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you, a few quick ones. First, Bill, you mentioned the financing impact on the tender. Can you talk to the financing aspects of that?","Two, what's the latest on your ongoing HUMIRA IP litigation, and are there any milestones or dates we should be aware of?","And lastly, Rick, back to corporate strategy, I was curious how you balance your views on short-term stock valuation with the reality that your enterprise value is quite large, bigger than Merck's for example, and many of the companies in biopharma. So I know you don't want to be bigger just to be bigger, but it does seem that you have a unique opportunity on a relative basis, especially as your stock recovers here on the back of today's news. Thanks.","William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.","So on the financing, recognized financing costs include lost interest income as well as interest expense. So obviously, we're going to deploy a sizable amount of our cash to this. We may have to top that off with some short-term loans just based on the timing of moving cash around between geographies, but this is not going to require any long-term financing.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","On the HUMIRA litigation, I would not say there's anything really new to report there. And frankly, litigation is probably not something we're going to spend a lot of time describing in a high level of detail. But what I can tell you on the current litigation is it is proceeding as we have described to you, so the time windows are consistent with what we've described to you. And I wouldn't expect any kind of significant event for quite some period of time as we go through the normal process that you go through in a litigation process like discovery, et cetera. So this is going to play out over years, as we've described to you before. So there's really nothing new to report there from that perspective.","I think you make an excellent point about the value of our company, the enterprise value of our company. Obviously, the P\/E of the stock compared to where it was several years ago, all of those things basically create an opportunity that if you wanted to do a larger transaction where you were using stock, it certainly puts you in a much better position to be able to do that. And so that makes obvious sense in what you're describing and certainly gives us the ability to be able to do things like that.","We tend to look at what we're going to do to build the business around the backdrop of what our company's value proposition is and we're trying to drive. Our company value proposition is that we are committed to drive top-tier growth over the long term and build a pipeline that is capable of being able to drive us at that level despite all of the ins and outs that will occur in the business going forward and be able to perform at that level. If we thought a large transaction was what was necessary to be able to do that, obviously we would pursue a large transaction.","But what I've said to you many quarters in a row now, we're in the fortunate position, like this quarter where we're driving a tremendous amount of growth, as we look forward, we believe we can continue to drive a significant amount of growth, a top-tier level of growth. You can never have enough pipeline in the business that we're in. and so we obviously have a very strong desire to continue to build our pipeline. But right now, we're building it more around more individual products or platforms, bolt-on kinds of platforms. And most of the time, those don't require stock to be the vehicle by which you acquire those assets. That's not to say we haven't done it. We obviously had stock in other transactions like Pharmacyclics, as an example. But that was more around the dynamics of the transaction that drove it than the need to have to do it through that vehicle.","So I think your point is valid. Our goal will be to continue to build the value of the company, so I would expect that we'll be in that position for quite some time. And we'll continue to evaluate what our strategic plan is to build it. But right now, that is our area of focus, more these bolt-ons and building the mid-stage and the early-stage pipeline.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for the color.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Gregg. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from Vamil Divan of Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks so much for taking my questions. A couple quick follow-up ones on Rova-T and then one the co-pay accumulator side. Just on Rova-T, can you disclose what the cutoff was that you used for the high DLL3 expression in TRINITY? I don't think those are in the press release. I'm not sure if you've disclosed it since then. And also, if you can, just comment a little bit on the toxicity side. Obviously, comments around the efficacy your\\ made just in terms...","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","We're having a little bit of a tough time hearing you. I don't know if you can hear us all right.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, I'm sorry. I can hear you fine. I'll try again. Just quickly on Rova-T, just what the cutoff was for high expression for DLL3 in the TRINITY trial and any comments on the toxicity side.","And on the co-pay accumulator programs, I'm just curious. As we've talked to consultants on this one, they think the impact might be more for newer products as they get launched because they don't \u2013 payers may not want to disrupt a large number of patients already on something like HUMIRA. So do you think is a bigger risk for newer products like upadacitinib and risankizumab as they get launched, or do you think this is a significant risk for established products like HUMIRA and Enbrel right now?","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Mike, why don't you cover the first one? I'll cover the second one.","Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.","So on Rova-T, the cutoff for DLL3 high expressers had to do with percentage of cells expressing, and we've looked at cutoffs like 25% and 75% of cells. Now what we found is that most of the positives are high positives because then when this is expressed, it's expressed pretty broadly. But those are the thresholds that we've looked at. I had a hard time hearing the second part of your Rova-T question. I believe it was about the safety that we observed in the TRINITY trial. Is that correct?","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yes, just how did that compare to what you were expecting? I think it looks a little bit more like...","Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.","So the safety in TRINITY has looked very consistent with what we observed in the Phase 1b and was very consistent with our expectations. Some of the key events were actually present in lower percentages of patients, at least numerically, in TRINITY as compared to the Phase 1b, so for example, the sorts of AEs that we look at, like the effusions and the other AEs that were identified the Phase 1b trial. But overall, I would say it was very consistent with our Phase 1b experience and very consistent with our expectations.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay. On the co-pay accumulator programs, I have not heard that description that you've described. But look, it's like anything else. There are lots and lots of programs out there. Could there be a program that was similar to what you're describing? Certainly, that can be the case.","I would say in general, as we look at these and as we think about them, essentially what they're designed to do is to raise the co-pay to a higher level. They're typically high-deductible plans that have a higher co-pay, and they try to force back on the patient a higher level of that co-pay and their responsibility to that co-pay. The ones I've seen are built around \u2013 they cover all expenses, medical expenses that that patient has, so not just drugs but physicians or hospitalization or all those kinds of costs.","And so essentially what it does is what I described before, is you may have a co-pay that's $4,000. The average is between $4,000 and $5,000 in these programs. There are some that go as high as $10,000, but the average is more like $4,000 to $5,000. Let's say the typical co-pay would be closer to $1,500 to $2,000 on a typical medical program. So you have to get to a much higher co-pay in order for the insurance company to take on the greater responsibility. And that is not specific to a product, at least in the experiences that I've seen.","As I said, I don't view them as a major threat. I view them as extremely bad healthcare policy because I think trying to put that level of burden on a patient who needs a chronic medication just is not the appropriate way to be able to try to manage those patients over the long term. But having said that, this is a relatively small percentage, and we think the biggest impact will be that it will incur some additional costs for those patients going forward. And therefore, we are reflecting some of that cost in our P&L going forward as well.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, thanks, and sorry about the audio there. Thanks.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Vamil. Ylonne, we have time for one final question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, thanks very much. I had a few questions. First, could you just tell us what percentage of the U.S. population has a co-pay accumulator in their benefits? I just don't have a good understanding of where we are today. I thought it was a tiny percentage of the country, yet it is having an impact in 2018 when it's just getting started.","Second, with respect to the upadacitinib DVT and PE figures of five patients versus four in control, my sense was that the foreign control included three on HUMIRA, one on placebo. And I guess my question is when do you think we'll get a better sense for the DVT and PE figures versus placebo?","And then finally, with respect to your expectations for HUMIRA ex-U.S. sales declines in 2019 after biosimilars hit, I recall the company talking about potentially a 15% to 20% sales decline next year for ex-U.S. HUMIRA. And I just wanted to make sure that I have that right, or maybe you can remind me what your expectations are. Thanks very much.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay. So, David, I'll do one and three. Mike will cover number two. So if you look at co-pay accumulators, I can tell you this is our internal data, so it will give you some idea. There are roughly about 20% of patients in the U.S. that are on high-deductibility plans now. Of those, about 20% or so have co-pay accumulators associated with them, so that gets you to this about 4% of the overall HUMIRA population.","Now, I think one of the things that will happen over time is for those patients that can select out of these programs, I can tell you we're getting a lot of feedback from patient groups that are extremely unhappy with this policy. And I think those patients that have the flexibility to elect out of a high deductibility plan that has it that use chronic drugs or have significant levels of medical care that is associated with a chronic condition, I think they will exit these programs because these programs don't make a tremendous amount of sense for them. It may be that you have a lower cost of your premium up front but ultimately when they get hit with a big co-pay, that becomes a difficult thing for them to manage their way through. So we could see that percentage come down.","Now in fairness, there are certain employers that that's the only program that they offer. And so for those people, they won't have any choice of how they try to deal with it. But it's still a relatively small percentage. You said it's having a big impact in 2018. If you look at the grand scheme of HUMIRA, I wouldn't exactly describe this as a big impact. But there could be some costs associated with it, and we want to make sure we've reflected those costs. We haven't seen, as I said before, any impact yet. We're going to have to measure it as we get into second and third quarter and see exactly what we experience. We are committed to try to maintain those patients on therapy because we think that's the right thing to do.","On HUMIRA OUS decline, your recollection I think is reasonably correct. I'd say we updated \u2013 and I'm trying to remember which call it was where we took it up slightly to 18% to 20% was the latest erosion curve that we described. The bulk of that probably will occur between the fourth quarter of this year and the end of 2019 because we would expect that the impact to be able to defend that volume will play out over that period of time, and then there will be more modest declines or pressure going forward.","And so I would say right now we're still thinking it's in that 20% range, 18% to 20% range, but we needed to see some experience. I think without seeing actually what their launch strategy looks like, we're modeling everything against what we've seen with Remicade and what we're seeing right now with Enbrel. And what we're modeling here is pretty consistent with what we're seeing out there. I don't fundamentally believe we should see something a lot different, but we want to see what that experience looks like. If it's different than what we've described, we'll obviously update the market once we have more experience with it.","Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay, so with respect to the question on upadacitinib and what we've seen in the controlled portions of our trials, as I stated in my prepared remarks, we've seen five patients in the upadacitinib-treated patients and four in the comparators. It's important to keep in mind that comparators range across these studies and what we call placebo is actually different background therapy in different studies, so a placebo on a monotherapy study is minimal background therapy. It might be NSAIDs and other things. In a methotrexate-inadequate responder study, placebo sits (01:19:03) on top of continued methotrexate. And of course, our HUMIRA study was blinded, so there actually is placebo administered there to maintain the blind. But of those case splits that we talked about, three were on HUMIRA and one came from our study that was identified as placebo. That patient was on continued methotrexate.","In terms of when we'll get our next tranche of data, that will be with the next study, the SELECT-EARLY study, which we said will read out in the coming months. That's also a substantial study with longer control periods.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, David.
